{"Q1001": {"id": "Q1001", "sentence": "In 1915, aged 45, Gandhi returned to India.", "mentions": "Gandhi", "entities": "Mahatma Gandhi", "answer": "Q1001", "brief": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (; GAHN-dee; 2 October 1869 \u2013 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule, and to later inspire movements for  civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mah\u0101tm\u0101 (Sanskrit: \"great-souled\", \"venerable\"), first applied to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used throughout the world.Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891.  After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.  He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination.\nAssuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above all, achieving swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi adopted the short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of identification with India's rural poor. He began to live in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of both introspection and political protest. Bringing anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians, Gandhi led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930 and in calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned many times and for many years in both South Africa and India.\nGandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism was challenged in the early 1940s by a Muslim nationalism which demanded a separate homeland for Muslims within British India. In August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions, a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Abstaining from the official celebration of independence, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to alleviate distress. In the months following, he undertook several hunger strikes to stop the religious violence. The last of these, begun in Delhi on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Although the Government of India relented, as did the religious rioters, the belief that Gandhi had been too resolute in his defence of both Pakistan and Indian Muslims, especially those besieged in Delhi, spread among some Hindus in India. Among these was Nathuram Godse, a militant Hindu nationalist from western India, who assassinated Gandhi by firing three bullets into the chest at an inter-faith prayer meeting in Delhi on 30 January 1948.Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is commonly, though not formally, considered the Father of the Nation in India and was commonly called Bapu (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa).", "img_list": ["Q1001_0.jpg", "Q1001_1.svg", "Q1001_2.jpg", "Q1001_3.gif", "Q1001_4.svg", "Q1001_5.jpg", "Q1001_6.jpg", "Q1001_7.jpg", "Q1001_8.jpg", "Q1001_9.jpg", "Q1001_10.jpg", "Q1001_11.jpg", "Q1001_12.jpg", "Q1001_13.jpg", "Q1001_14.jpg", "Q1001_15.jpg", "Q1001_16.jpg", "Q1001_17.jpg", "Q1001_18.jpg", "Q1001_19.jpg", "Q1001_20.jpg", "Q1001_21.jpg", "Q1001_22.jpg", "Q1001_23.jpg", "Q1001_24.jpg", "Q1001_25.jpg", "Q1001_26.jpg", "Q1001_27.jpg", "Q1001_28.jpg", "Q1001_29.jpg", "Q1001_30.jpg", "Q1001_31.jpg", "Q1001_32.jpg", "Q1001_33.jpg", "Q1001_34.svg", "Q1001_35.jpg", "Q1001_36.svg", "Q1001_37.jpg", "Q1001_38.ogv", "Q1001_39.ogv", "Q1001_40.png", "Q1001_41.svg", "Q1001_42.jpg", "Q1001_43.jpg", "Q1001_44.svg", "Q1001_45.svg", "Q1001_46.svg", "Q1001_47.png"], "summary": "Mahatma Gandhi:Sex: male.

Nehru was a principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's prime minister for 17 years. Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, his books written in prison, such as Letters from a Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936), and The Discovery of India (1946), have been read around the world.\nThe son of Motilal Nehru, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England\u2014at Harrow School and  Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple.  He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation.  He joined the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his political heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.\nNehru and the Congress dominated Indian politics during the 1930s. Nehru promoted the idea of the secular nation-state in the 1937 Indian provincial elections, allowing the Congress to sweep the elections, and to form governments in several provinces. In September 1939, the Congress ministries resigned to protest Viceroy Lord Linlithgow's decision to join the war without consulting them. After the All India Congress Committee's Quit India Resolution of 8 August 1942, senior Congress leaders were imprisoned and for a time the organization was crushed.  Nehru, who had reluctantly heeded Gandhi's call for immediate independence, and had desired instead to support the Allied war effort during World War II, came out of a lengthy prison term to a much altered political landscape. The Muslim League, under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had come to dominate Muslim politics in the interim. In the 1946 provincial elections, Congress won the elections but the League won all the seats reserved for Muslims, which the British interpreted to be a clear mandate for Pakistan in some form. Nehru became the interim prime minister of India in September 1946, with the League joining his government with some hesitancy in October 1946.\nUpon India's independence on August 15, 1947, Nehru gave a critically acclaimed speech, \"Tryst with Destiny\"; he was sworn in as the Dominion of India's prime minister and raised the Indian flag at the Red Fort in Delhi. On January 26, 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, Nehru became the Republic of India's first prime minister. He embarked on an ambitious program of economic, social, and political reforms. Nehru promoted a pluralistic multi-party democracy. In foreign affairs, he played a leading role in establishing the Non-Aligned Movement, a group of nations that did not seek membership in the two main ideological blocs of the 1950s.\nUnder Nehru's leadership, the Congress emerged as a catch-all party, dominating national and state-level politics and winning elections in 1951, 1957 and 1962. Nehru remained popular with the Indian people despite India's defeat in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 for which he was widely blamed. His premiership spanning 16 years, 286 days\u2014which is, to date, longest in India\u2014ended with his death on 27 May 1964 due to a heart attack.

A member of the First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating his political rival Pompey in a civil war, and subsequently became dictator of Rome from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.\nIn 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus and Pompey formed the First Triumvirate, a political alliance that dominated Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power as Populares were opposed by the Optimates within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the Roman Republic through a string of military victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, which greatly extended Roman territory. During this time he both invaded Britain and built a bridge across the Rhine river. These achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the death of Crassus in 53 BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. In 49 BC, Caesar openly defied the Senate's authority by crossing the Rubicon and marching towards Rome at the head of an army. This began Caesar's civil war, which he won, leaving him in a position of near unchallenged power and influence in 45 BC.\nAfter assuming control of government, Caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Republic. He initiated land reform and support for veterans. He centralized the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator for life\" (dictator perpetuo). His populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites, who began to conspire against him. On the Ides of March (15 March), 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Brutus and Cassius, who stabbed him to death. A new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar's great-nephew and adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the last civil war of the Roman Republic. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began.\nCaesar was an accomplished author and historian as well as a statesman; much of his life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns. Other contemporary sources include the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of Sallust. Later biographies of Caesar by Suetonius and Plutarch are also important sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history. His cognomen was subsequently adopted as a synonym for \"Emperor\"; the title \"Caesar\" was used throughout the Roman Empire, giving rise to modern cognates such as Kaiser and Tsar. He has frequently appeared in literary and artistic works, and his political philosophy, known as Caesarism, inspired politicians into the modern era.", "img_list": ["Q1048_0.JPG", "Q1048_1.jpg", "Q1048_2.gif", "Q1048_3.jpg", "Q1048_4.jpg", "Q1048_5.jpg", "Q1048_6.jpg", "Q1048_7.jpg", "Q1048_8.jpg", "Q1048_9.JPG", "Q1048_10.jpg", "Q1048_11.ogg", "Q1048_12.ogg", "Q1048_13.ogg", "Q1048_14.jpg", "Q1048_15.tif", "Q1048_16.jpg", "Q1048_17.jpg", "Q1048_18.jpg", "Q1048_19.jpg", "Q1048_20.jpg", "Q1048_21.jpg", "Q1048_22.jpg", "Q1048_23.png", "Q1048_24.jpg", "Q1048_25.jpg", "Q1048_26.jpg", "Q1048_27.jpg", "Q1048_28.png", "Q1048_29.jpg", "Q1048_30.svg", "Q1048_31.svg", "Q1048_32.jpg", "Q1048_33.jpg", "Q1048_34.svg"], "summary": "Julius Caesar:Sex: male.

Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister to have been born after India's independence in 1947 and the second prime minister not belonging to the Indian National Congress to have won two consecutive majorities in the Lok Sabha, or lower house of Indian of parliament.\nBorn and raised in Vadnagar, a small town in northeastern Gujarat, Modi completed his secondary education there.  He was introduced to the RSS at age eight. He has drawn attention to having to work as a child in his father's tea stall on the Vadnagar railway station platform, a description that has not been reliably corroborated. At age 18, Modi was married to Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He left his parental home where she had come to live.  He first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since.  Modi has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, Modi went into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots in which 1044 people were killed, three-quarters of whom were Muslim, or otherwise criticised for its management of the crisis. The Supreme Court remarked that Narendra Modi was like a Modern-day Nero, looking the other way as innocent women and children were burning. A Supreme Court of India-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally. While his policies as chief minister\u2014credited with encouraging economic growth\u2014have received praise, his administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the Indian lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the Planning Commission. He began a high-profile sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes and transformation of taxation regime, and  weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws.\nUnder Modi's tenure, India has experienced democratic backsliding. Following his party's victory in the 2019 general election, his administration revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and also introduced the Citizenship Amendment Act, which resulted in widespread protests across the country. Described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.", "img_list": ["Q1058_0.svg", "Q1058_1.svg", "Q1058_2.svg", "Q1058_3.svg", "Q1058_4.svg", "Q1058_5.svg", "Q1058_6.svg", "Q1058_7.svg", "Q1058_8.svg", "Q1058_9.svg", "Q1058_10.svg", "Q1058_11.svg", "Q1058_12.svg", "Q1058_13.svg", "Q1058_14.svg", "Q1058_15.svg", "Q1058_16.svg", "Q1058_17.svg", "Q1058_18.svg", "Q1058_19.svg", "Q1058_20.svg", "Q1058_21.svg", "Q1058_22.svg", "Q1058_23.svg", "Q1058_24.svg", "Q1058_25.svg", "Q1058_26.svg", "Q1058_27.svg", "Q1058_28.svg", "Q1058_29.svg", "Q1058_30.svg", "Q1058_31.svg", "Q1058_32.svg", "Q1058_33.svg", "Q1058_34.svg", "Q1058_35.svg", "Q1058_36.svg", "Q1058_37.svg", "Q1058_38.svg", "Q1058_39.svg", "Q1058_40.svg", "Q1058_41.svg", "Q1058_42.svg", "Q1058_43.svg", "Q1058_44.svg", "Q1058_45.svg", "Q1058_46.svg", "Q1058_47.svg", "Q1058_48.svg", "Q1058_49.svg", "Q1058_50.svg", "Q1058_51.svg", "Q1058_52.svg", "Q1058_53.svg", "Q1058_54.svg", "Q1058_55.svg", "Q1058_56.svg", "Q1058_57.svg", "Q1058_58.svg", "Q1058_59.svg", "Q1058_60.svg", "Q1058_61.svg", "Q1058_62.svg", "Q1058_63.svg", "Q1058_64.svg", "Q1058_65.svg", "Q1058_66.svg", "Q1058_67.svg", "Q1058_68.svg", "Q1058_69.svg", "Q1058_70.svg", "Q1058_71.svg", "Q1058_72.svg", "Q1058_73.svg", "Q1058_74.svg", "Q1058_75.svg", "Q1058_76.svg", "Q1058_77.svg", "Q1058_78.svg", "Q1058_79.svg", "Q1058_80.svg", "Q1058_81.svg", "Q1058_82.svg", "Q1058_83.svg", "Q1058_84.svg", "Q1058_85.svg", "Q1058_86.svg", "Q1058_87.svg", "Q1058_88.svg", "Q1058_89.svg", "Q1058_90.svg", "Q1058_91.svg", "Q1058_92.svg", "Q1058_93.svg", "Q1058_94.svg", "Q1058_95.svg", "Q1058_96.svg", "Q1058_97.svg", "Q1058_98.svg", "Q1058_99.svg", "Q1058_100.svg", "Q1058_101.svg", "Q1058_102.svg", "Q1058_103.svg", "Q1058_104.svg", "Q1058_105.svg", "Q1058_106.svg", "Q1058_107.svg", "Q1058_108.svg", "Q1058_109.svg", "Q1058_110.svg", "Q1058_111.svg", "Q1058_112.svg", "Q1058_113.svg", "Q1058_114.svg", "Q1058_115.svg", "Q1058_116.svg", "Q1058_117.svg", "Q1058_118.svg", "Q1058_119.svg", "Q1058_120.svg", "Q1058_121.svg", "Q1058_122.svg", "Q1058_123.svg", "Q1058_124.svg", "Q1058_125.svg", "Q1058_126.svg", "Q1058_127.svg", "Q1058_128.svg", "Q1058_129.svg", "Q1058_130.svg", "Q1058_131.svg", "Q1058_132.svg", "Q1058_133.svg", "Q1058_134.svg", "Q1058_135.svg", "Q1058_136.svg", "Q1058_137.svg", "Q1058_138.svg", "Q1058_139.svg", "Q1058_140.svg", "Q1058_141.svg", "Q1058_142.svg", "Q1058_143.svg", "Q1058_144.svg", "Q1058_145.svg", "Q1058_146.svg", "Q1058_147.svg", "Q1058_148.svg", "Q1058_149.svg", "Q1058_150.svg", "Q1058_151.svg", "Q1058_152.svg", "Q1058_153.svg", "Q1058_154.svg", "Q1058_155.svg", "Q1058_156.svg", "Q1058_157.svg", "Q1058_158.svg", "Q1058_159.svg", "Q1058_160.svg", "Q1058_161.svg", "Q1058_162.svg", "Q1058_163.svg", "Q1058_164.svg", "Q1058_165.svg", "Q1058_166.svg", "Q1058_167.svg", "Q1058_168.svg", "Q1058_169.svg", "Q1058_170.png", "Q1058_171.svg", "Q1058_172.svg", "Q1058_173.jpg", "Q1058_174.svg", "Q1058_175.jpg", "Q1058_176.jpg", "Q1058_177.jpg", "Q1058_178.jpg", "Q1058_179.JPG", "Q1058_180.jpg", "Q1058_181.ogg", "Q1058_182.jpg", "Q1058_183.svg", "Q1058_184.jpg", "Q1058_185.jpg", "Q1058_186.png", "Q1058_187.png", "Q1058_188.jpg", "Q1058_189.jpg", "Q1058_190.jpg", "Q1058_191.jpg", "Q1058_192.svg", "Q1058_193.jpg", "Q1058_194.svg", "Q1058_195.png", "Q1058_196.jpg", "Q1058_197.png", "Q1058_198.jpg", "Q1058_199.jpg", "Q1058_200.jpg", "Q1058_201.jpg", "Q1058_202.jpg", "Q1058_203.jpg", "Q1058_204.jpg", "Q1058_205.jpg", "Q1058_206.jpg", "Q1058_207.jpg", "Q1058_208.jpg", "Q1058_209.jpg", "Q1058_210.jpg", "Q1058_211.jpg", "Q1058_212.png", "Q1058_213.svg", "Q1058_214.svg", "Q1058_215.svg", "Q1058_216.svg", "Q1058_221.svg", "Q1058_223.svg", "Q1058_225.svg", "Q1058_231.svg", "Q1058_232.svg", "Q1058_233.svg", "Q1058_234.svg", "Q1058_235.svg", "Q1058_236.svg", "Q1058_237.svg", "Q1058_238.svg", "Q1058_239.svg", "Q1058_240.svg", "Q1058_241.svg", "Q1058_242.svg"], "summary": "Narendra Modi:Sex: male.

His Divine Comedy, originally called Comed\u00eca (modern Italian: Commedia) and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio, is widely considered one of the most important poems of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language.Dante is known for establishing the use of the vernacular in literature at a time when most poetry was written in Latin, which was accessible only to the most educated readers. His De vulgari eloquentia (On Eloquence in the Vernacular) was one of the first scholarly defenses of the vernacular. His use of the Tuscan dialect for works such as The New Life (1295) and Divine Comedy helped establish the modern-day standardized Italian language. His work set a precedent that important Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would later follow.\nDante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy. His depictions of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art and literature. He is cited as an influence on such English writers as Geoffrey Chaucer, John Milton and Alfred Tennyson, among many others. In addition, the first use of the interlocking three-line rhyme scheme, or the terza rima, is attributed to him.

He previously served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992, and as attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton became known as a New Democrat, as many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election.\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and he later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive terms as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, Clinton became the third-youngest president of the United States.\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, however, he was reelected in a landslide. During this time Clinton began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy advocating for welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. He also appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Dayton Peace agreement, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\nClinton's second term would be dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal which began in 1996, when Clinton began a sexual affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In January 1998, news of the sexual relationship made tabloid headlines. The scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached after Andrew Johnson. The two impeachment articles that the house passed were based on Clinton using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and that Clinton lied under oath. The following year saw the impeachment trial begin in the Senate, but Clinton was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, the conviction threshold.\nClinton left office with the highest end-of-term approval rating of any U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault against him have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work.

She was the 3rd prime minister of India and was also the first and, to date, only female prime minister of India. Gandhi was the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, the 1st prime minister of India. She served as prime minister from January 1966 to March 1977 and again from January 1980 until her assassination in October 1984, making her the second longest-serving Indian prime minister after her father.\nDuring Nehru's premiership from 1947 to 1964, Gandhi was considered a key assistant and accompanied him on his numerous foreign trips. She was elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, she was appointed as a member of the Rajya Sabha (upper house) and became a member of Lal Bahadur Shastri's cabinet as Minister of Information and Broadcasting. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966 (upon the death of Shastri), she defeated her rival Morarji Desai to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri, after his death, as Prime Minister of India.\nAs prime minister, Gandhi was known for her political intransigency and unprecedented centralisation of power. She went to war with Pakistan in support of the independence movement and war of independence in East Pakistan, which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of Bangladesh, as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the sole regional power of South Asia. Citing separatist tendencies, and in response to a call for revolution, Gandhi instituted a state of emergency from 1975 to 1977 where basic civil liberties were suspended and the press was censored. Widespread atrocities were carried out during the emergency. In 1980, she returned to power after free and fair elections. After Gandhi ordered military action in the Golden Temple in Operation Blue Star, her own bodyguards and Sikh nationalists assassinated her on 31 October 1984.\nIn 1999, Indira Gandhi was named \"Woman of the Millennium\" in an online poll organised by the BBC. In 2020, Gandhi was named by Time magazine among the world's 100 powerful women who defined the last century.", "img_list": ["Q1149_0.jpg", "Q1149_1.tif", "Q1149_2.svg", "Q1149_3.jpg", "Q1149_4.JPG", "Q1149_5.ogg", "Q1149_6.png", "Q1149_7.jpg", "Q1149_8.jpg", "Q1149_9.jpg", "Q1149_10.tif", "Q1149_11.jpg", "Q1149_12.jpg", "Q1149_13.JPG", "Q1149_14.jpg", "Q1149_15.jpg", "Q1149_16.svg", "Q1149_17.jpg", "Q1149_18.jpg", "Q1149_19.svg", "Q1149_20.jpg", "Q1149_21.JPG", "Q1149_22.svg", "Q1149_23.png", "Q1149_24.svg", "Q1149_25.svg", "Q1149_26.svg", "Q1149_27.jpg"], "summary": "Indira Gandhi:Sex: female.

Lennon was characterised by the rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing and drawings, on film, and in interviews. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains  the most successful in history.Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called \"the smart Beatle\", he was initially the group's de facto leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. In the mid-1960s, Lennon authored In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works, two collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with \"All You Need Is Love\", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, the multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-Ins for Peace, and quit the Beatles to embark on a solo career.\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Lennon and Ono collaborated on many records, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, his solo debut John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band, and the international top 10 singles  \"Give Peace a Chance\", \"Instant Karma!\", \"Imagine\" and \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\". Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year attempt by the Richard Nixon administration to deport him. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, a period that included chart-topping collaborations with Elton John (\"Whatever Gets You thru the Night\") and David Bowie (\"Fame\"). Following a five-year hiatus, Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration Double Fantasy. He was shot and killed by a Beatles fan, Mark David Chapman, three weeks after the album's release.\nAs a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number-one singles in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Double Fantasy, his best-selling album, won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 1982, Lennon won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC history poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and thirty-eighth greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).", "img_list": ["Q1203_0.jpg", "Q1203_1.svg", "Q1203_2.svg", "Q1203_3.jpg", "Q1203_4.svg", "Q1203_5.svg", "Q1203_6.svg", "Q1203_7.jpg", "Q1203_8.jpg", "Q1203_9.jpg", "Q1203_10.jpg", "Q1203_11.jpg", "Q1203_12.JPG", "Q1203_13.jpg", "Q1203_14.jpg", "Q1203_15.jpg", "Q1203_16.jpg", "Q1203_17.jpg", "Q1203_18.jpg", "Q1203_19.jpg", "Q1203_20.jpg", "Q1203_21.jpg", "Q1203_22.JPG", "Q1203_23.png", "Q1203_24.jpg", "Q1203_25.jpg", "Q1203_26.jpg", "Q1203_27.jpg", "Q1203_28.JPG", "Q1203_29.svg", "Q1203_30.jpg"], "summary": "John Lennon:Sex: male.

Due to his dominant position in Italian politics, some critics have sometimes referred to him as Re Giorgio (\"King George\"). He is the longest serving president in the history of the modern Italian Republic, which has been in existence since 1946.\nNapolitano was a longtime member of the Italian Communist Party and of its post-Communist social democratic successors, from the Democratic Party of the Left onwards. He was a leading member of a modernizing faction on the right of the party. First elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1953, he took an assiduous interest in parliamentary life and was President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1992 to 1994. He was Minister of the Interior from 1996 to 1998 under Romano Prodi.\nNapolitano was appointed a Senator for life in 2005 by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. In May 2006, he was elected by Parliament as President of Italy. During his first term of office, he oversaw governments both of the centre-left, led by Prodi, and the centre-right, led by Silvio Berlusconi. In November 2011, Berlusconi resigned as Prime Minister amid financial and economic problems.  Napolitano, in keeping with his constitutional role, then asked former EU commissioner Mario Monti to form a cabinet which was referred to as a \"government of the president\" by critics.When his seven-year presidential term expired in April 2013, Napolitano (then aged 87) reluctantly accepted re-election, becoming the first President of Italy to serve a second term, to safeguard the continuity of the country's institutions during the parliamentary deadlock that followed the 2013 general election. On being reelected as President with broad cross-party support in Parliament, he overcame the impasse by inviting Enrico Letta to propose a government in the form of a grand coalition. When Letta handed in his resignation on 14 February 2014, Napolitano mandated Matteo Renzi (Letta's factional challenger) to form a new government. After a record eight and a half years as President, Napolitano resigned at age 89 in January 2015.Napolitano was often accused by his critics of having transformed a largely ceremonial role into a political one, becoming, during the years of his tenure, the real kingmaker of Italian politics.

In February 2006, he began to campaign for the office of Secretary-General. Ban was initially considered to be a long shot for the office.

Cohen was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.\nCohen pursued a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s, and did not begin a music career until 1967 at the age of 33. His first album, Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967), was followed by three more albums of folk music: Songs from a Room (1969), Songs of Love and Hate (1971) and New Skin for the Old Ceremony (1974). His 1977 record Death of a Ladies' Man, co-written and produced by Phil Spector, was a move away from Cohen's previous minimalist sound. In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional Recent Songs, which blended his acoustic style with jazz, East Asian, and Mediterranean influences. Cohen's most famous song, \"Hallelujah\", was first released on his studio album Various Positions in 1984. I'm Your Man in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized productions. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, The Future, which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest.\nCohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of Ten New Songs, which was a major hit in Canada and Europe. His 11th album, Dear Heather, followed in 2004. Following a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2013, Cohen released three albums in the final four years of his life: Old Ideas (2012), Popular Problems (2014) and You Want It Darker (2016), the last of which was released three weeks before his death.

A. Hayek, was an Austrian-British economist, and philosopher who is best known for his defence of classical liberalism. Hayek shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Gunnar Myrdal for their work on money and economic fluctuations, and the interdependence of economic, social and institutional phenomena. His account of how changing prices communicate information that helps individuals coordinate their plans is widely regarded as an important achievement in economics, leading to his prize.Hayek served in World War I during his teenage years and said that this experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that had led to the war drew him into economics. At the University of Vienna, he studied economics, eventually receiving his doctoral degrees in law in 1921 and in political science in 1923. He subsequently lived and worked in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany; he became a British subject in 1938. Hayek's academic life was mostly spent at the London School of Economics, and later at the University of Chicago, and the University of Freiburg. Although he is widely considered a leader of the Austrian School of Economics, he also had close connections with the Chicago School of Economics. Hayek was also a major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th century and as the co-founder of Mont Pelerin Society he contributed to the revival of classical liberalism in the post-war era. His most popular work, The Road to Serfdom, has sold over 2.25 million copies (as of 2020).Hayek was appointed a Companion of Honour in 1984 for his academic contributions to economics. He was the first recipient of the Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize in 1984. He also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1991 from President George H. W. Bush.

He is best known for his political treatise The Prince (Il Principe), written about 1513. He has often been called the father of modern political philosophy and political science.For many years he served as a senior official in the Florentine Republic with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He wrote comedies, carnival songs, and poetry. His personal correspondence is also important to historians and scholars of Italian correspondence. He worked as secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power.\nMachiavelli's name came to evoke unscrupulous acts of the sort he advised most famously in his work, The Prince. He claimed that his experience and reading of history showed him that politics have always been played with deception, treachery, and crime. He also notably said that a ruler who is establishing a kingdom or a republic, and is criticized for his deeds, including violence, should be excused when the intention and the result is beneficial. Machiavelli's Prince has had a mixed reaction. Some considered it a straightforward description of the evil means used by bad rulers; others read in it evil recommendations to tyrants to help them maintain their power. Even into recent times, some scholars, such as Leo Strauss, have stated critics who accuse Machiavelli of being a \"teacher of evil\" should be taken seriously.The term Machiavellian often connotes political deceit, deviousness, and realpolitik. Even though Machiavelli has become most famous for his work on principalities, scholars also give attention to the exhortations in his other works of political philosophy. While much less well known than The Prince, the Discourses on Livy (composed c.\u20091517) has been said to have paved the way of modern republicanism.

His status as the founder of the Roman Principate (the first phase of the Roman Empire) has consolidated a legacy as one of the most effective leaders in human history. The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the Pax Romana. The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the \"Year of the Four Emperors\" over the imperial succession.\nOriginally named Gaius Octavius, he was born into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir; as a result, he inherited Caesar's name, estate, and the loyalty of his legions. He, Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the Battle of Philippi (42 BC), the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as de facto dictators. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members; Lepidus was exiled in 36 BC and Antony was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC.\nAfter the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward fa\u00e7ade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the Roman Senate, the executive magistrates and the legislative assemblies, yet maintained autocratic authority by having the Senate grant him lifetime tenure as supreme military command, tribune and censor. A similar ambiguity is seen in his chosen names, the implied rejection of monarchical titles whereby he called himself Princeps Civitatis (First Citizen) juxtaposed with his adoption of the ancient title Augustus.\nAugustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing Egypt, Dalmatia, Pannonia, Noricum and Raetia, expanding possessions in Africa, and completing the conquest of Hispania, but suffered a major setback in Germania. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of client states and made peace with the Parthian Empire through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed networks of roads with an official courier system, established a standing army, established the Praetorian Guard, official police and fire-fighting services for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign. Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75, probably from natural causes. Persistent rumors, substantiated somewhat by deaths in the imperial family, have claimed his wife Livia poisoned him.

He reigned from AD 14 until 37, succeeding his stepfather, the first Roman emperor Augustus.\nTiberius was born in Rome in 42 BC. His father was the politician Tiberius Claudius Nero and his mother was Livia Drusilla, who would eventually divorce his father, and marry the future-emperor Augustus in 38 BC. Following the untimely deaths of Augustus' two grandsons and adopted heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, Tiberius was designated Augustus' successor. Prior to this, Tiberius had proved himself an able diplomat, and one of the most successful Roman generals: his conquests of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania laid the foundations for the empire's northern frontier. Early in his career, Tiberius was happily married to Vipsania, daughter of Augustus' friend, distinguished general and intended heir, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. They had a son, Drusus Julius Caesar. After Agrippa died, Augustus insisted that Tiberius divorce Vipsania and marry his own daughter (Tiberius' step-sister) Julia. Tiberius reluctantly gave in. This second marriage proved scandalous, deeply unhappy, and childless; Julia was sent into exile. Tiberius adopted his nephew, the able and popular Germanicus, as heir. On Augustus' death in AD 14, Tiberius became princeps at the age of 55.\nTiberius seems to have taken on the responsibilities of head of state with great reluctance, and perhaps a genuine sense of inadequacy in the role, compared to the capable, self-confident and charismatic Augustus. From the outset, Tiberius had a difficult, resentful relationship with his senate, and suspected many of plotting against him. Nevertheless, he proved to be an effective and efficient administrator. However, after the deaths of his nephew Germanicus in 19 AD and his son Drusus in 23 AD, Tiberius became still more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his controversial praetorian prefects Sejanus, whom he later had executed for treason, and Sejanus' replacement, Macro. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Germanicus' son Caligula, who managed to squander much of the wealth that Tiberius had accumulated in the public and Imperial coffers through his lavish building projects and varyingly successful military endeavours.\nTiberius allowed his own worship as a divinity (divus) in only one temple, in Rome's eastern provinces, while he promoted the cult to the deceased Augustus throughout the empire. When Tiberius died, he was given a sumptuous funeral befitting his office, but no divine honours. He came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and somber ruler who never really wanted to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him \"the gloomiest of men.\"", "img_list": ["Q1407_0.jpg", "Q1407_1.jpg", "Q1407_2.jpg", "Q1407_3.jpg", "Q1407_4.jpg", "Q1407_5.png", "Q1407_6.jpg", "Q1407_7.JPG", "Q1407_8.jpg", "Q1407_9.svg", "Q1407_10.png", "Q1407_11.png", "Q1407_12.jpg", "Q1407_13.jpg", "Q1407_14.JPG", "Q1407_15.JPG", "Q1407_16.jpg", "Q1407_17.jpg", "Q1407_18.jpg", "Q1407_19.svg"], "summary": "Tiberius:Sex: male.

The son of the popular Roman general Germanicus and Augustus's granddaughter Agrippina the Elder, Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\nGermanicus's uncle and adoptive father, Tiberius, succeeded Augustus as emperor of Rome in AD 14. Although Gaius was named after Gaius Julius Caesar, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" (meaning \"little [soldier's] boot\") from his father's soldiers during their campaign in Germania. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. In 26, Tiberius withdrew from public life to the island of Capri, and in 31, Caligula joined him there. Following the death of Tiberius in 37, Caligula succeeded him as emperor.\nThere are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, though he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant. While the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and he initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province.\nIn early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, however. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius, the next Roman emperor.

A member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, Claudius was born to Drusus and Antonia Minor at Lugdunum in Roman Gaul, where his father was stationed as a military legate. He was the first Roman emperor to be born outside Italy. Nonetheless, Claudius was an Italic of Sabine origins. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, he was ostracized by his family and was excluded from public office until his consulship (which was shared with his nephew, Caligula, in 37).\nClaudius's infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges during the reigns of Tiberius and Caligula as potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to him being declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last adult male of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He expanded the imperial bureaucracy to include freedmen, and helped to restore the empire's finances after the excess of Caligula's reign.

After Poppaea's death in unclear circumstances, Nero in short succession married an aristocratic woman Statilia Messalina and another freedman, Sporus, whom he had castrated.\nNero's practical contributions to Rome's governance focused on diplomacy, trade, and culture. He ordered the construction of amphitheaters, promoted athletic games and contests, and made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician, and charioteer. This scandalised his aristocratic contemporaries as these occupations were usually the domain of slaves, public entertainers and infamous persons. The provision of such entertainments made Nero popular among lower-class citizens, but his performances undermined the Imperial dignity. The costs involved were borne by local elites either directly or through taxation, and were much resented. \nDuring Nero's reign, the general Corbulo fought the Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363, and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by the Iceni's queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish\u2013Roman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled, with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba, Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia. He fled Rome, and on 9 June AD 68 he committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors.\nMost Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign. The historian Tacitus claims the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. Suetonius tells that many Romans believed that the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear land for his planned  \"Golden House\". Tacitus claims that Nero seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and had them burned alive, seemingly motivated not by public justice but by personal cruelty. Some modern historians question the reliability of the ancient sources on Nero's tyrannical acts, considering his popularity among the Roman commoners. In the eastern provinces of the Empire, a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return. After his death, at least three leaders of short-lived, failed rebellions presented themselves as \"Nero reborn\" in order to gain popular support.", "img_list": ["Q1413_0.jpg", "Q1413_1.jpg", "Q1413_2.png", "Q1413_3.jpg", "Q1413_4.jpg", "Q1413_5.png", "Q1413_6.jpg", "Q1413_7.png", "Q1413_8.jpg", "Q1413_9.jpg", "Q1413_10.jpg", "Q1413_11.png", "Q1413_12.svg", "Q1413_13.jpg", "Q1413_14.jpg", "Q1413_15.svg"], "summary": "Nero:Sex: male.

During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the Senate, whose powers he drastically curtailed.\nDomitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. His 15-year reign was the longest since that of Tiberius. As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage, expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Caledonia (Scotland), and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against King Decebalus. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality, and by nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals.

He is also known for his philanthropic rule, overseeing extensive public building programs and implementing social welfare policies, which earned him his enduring reputation as the second of the Five Good Emperors who presided over an era of peace within the Empire and prosperity in the Mediterranean world.\nTrajan was born in Italica, close to modern Seville in present-day Spain, an Italic settlement in the Roman province of Hispania Baetica. Although misleadingly designated by some later writers as a provincial, his Ulpia gens came from Umbria and he was born in the senatorial family. Trajan rose to prominence during the reign of emperor Domitian. Serving as a legatus legionis in Hispania Tarraconensis, in 89 Trajan supported Domitian against a revolt on the Rhine led by Antonius Saturninus.

He was born into a Roman Italo-Hispanic family, which settled in Spain from the Italian city of Atri in Picenum. His father was of senatorial rank and was a first cousin of Emperor Trajan. Hadrian married Trajan's grand-niece Vibia Sabina early in his career, before Trajan became emperor and possibly at the behest of Trajan's wife Pompeia Plotina. Plotina and Trajan's close friend and adviser Lucius Licinius Sura were well disposed towards Hadrian. When Trajan died, his widow claimed that he had nominated Hadrian as emperor immediately before his death.\nRome's military and Senate approved Hadrian's succession, but four leading senators were unlawfully put to death soon after. They had opposed Hadrian or seemed to threaten his succession, and the Senate held him responsible for their deaths and never forgave him. He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan's expansionist policies and territorial gains in Mesopotamia, Assyria, Armenia, and parts of Dacia. Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders and the unification of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia.\nHadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests. He visited almost every province of the Empire, accompanied by an Imperial retinue of specialists and administrators. He encouraged military preparedness and discipline, and he fostered, designed, or personally subsidised various civil and religious institutions and building projects. In Rome itself, he rebuilt the Pantheon and constructed the vast Temple of Venus and Roma. In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the Serapeum of Alexandria. He was an ardent admirer of Greece and sought to make Athens the cultural capital of the Empire, so he ordered the construction of many opulent temples there. His intense relationship with Greek youth Antinous and the latter's untimely death led Hadrian to establish a widespread cult late in his reign. He suppressed the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea, but his reign was otherwise peaceful.\nHadrian's last years were marred by chronic illness. He saw the Bar Kokhba revolt as the failure of his panhellenic ideal. He executed two more senators for their alleged plots against him, and this provoked further resentment. His marriage to Vibia Sabina had been unhappy and childless; he adopted Antoninus Pius in 138 and nominated him as a successor, on the condition that Antoninus adopt Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus as his own heirs. Hadrian died the same year at Baiae, and Antoninus had him deified, despite opposition from the Senate. Edward Gibbon includes him among the Empire's \"Five Good Emperors\", a \"benevolent dictator\"; Hadrian's own Senate found him remote and authoritarian.

He ruled as a dictator under martial law from 1972 until 1981 and kept most of his martial law powers until he was deposed in 1986, branding his rule as \"constitutional authoritarianism\":\u200a414\u200a under his New Society Movement. One of the most controversial leaders of the 20th century, Marcos' rule was infamous for its corruption, extravagance, and brutality.Marcos gained political success by claiming to have been the \"most decorated war hero in the Philippines,\" but many of his claims have been found to be false, with United States Army documents describing his wartime claims as \"fraudulent\" and \"absurd.\" After World War II, he became a lawyer then served in the Philippine House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959 and the Philippine Senate from 1959 to 1965. He was elected the President of the Philippines in 1965 and presided over an economy that grew during the beginning of his 20-year rule but would end in the loss of livelihood, extreme poverty, and a crushing debt crisis. He pursued an aggressive program of infrastructure development funded by foreign debt, making him popular during his first term, although it would also trigger an inflationary crisis which would lead to social unrest in his second term. Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law on September 23, 1972, shortly before the end of his second term. Martial law was ratified in 1973 through a fraudulent referendum. The Constitution was revised, media outlets were silenced, and violence and oppression were used against the political opposition, Muslims, suspected communists, and ordinary citizens.After being elected for a third term in the 1981 Philippine presidential election, Marcos's popularity suffered greatly, due to the economic collapse that began in early 1983 and the public outrage over the assassination of opposition leader Senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr. later that year. This discontent, the resulting resurgence of the opposition in the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election, and the discovery of documents exposing his financial accounts and false war records led Marcos to call the snap election of 1986. Allegations of mass cheating, political turmoil, and human rights abuses led to the People Power Revolution of February 1986, which removed him from power. To avoid what could have been a military confrontation in Manila between pro- and anti-Marcos troops, Marcos was advised by US President Ronald Reagan through Senator Paul Laxalt to \"cut and cut cleanly.\" Marcos then fled with his family to Hawaii. He was succeeded as president by Aquino's widow, Corazon \"Cory\" Aquino.According to source documents provided by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), the Marcos family stole US$5 billion\u2013$10 billion from the Central Bank of the Philippines. The PCGG also maintained that the Marcos family enjoyed a decadent lifestyle, taking away billions of dollars from the Philippines between 1965 and 1986. His wife, Imelda Marcos, made infamous in her own right by the excesses that characterized her and her husband's conjugal dictatorship, is the source of the term \"Imeldific\". Two of their children, Imee Marcos and Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., are still active in Philippine politics. He and his wife currently hold the Guinness World Record for \"Greatest Robbery of a Government\".", "img_list": ["Q1463_0.png", "Q1463_1.svg", "Q1463_2.jpg", "Q1463_3.jpg", "Q1463_4.jpg", "Q1463_5.png", "Q1463_6.svg", "Q1463_7.svg", "Q1463_8.jpg", "Q1463_9.jpg", "Q1463_10.JPEG", "Q1463_11.JPEG", "Q1463_12.jpg", "Q1463_13.jpg", "Q1463_14.jpg", "Q1463_15.jpg", "Q1463_16.jpg", "Q1463_17.svg", "Q1463_18.svg", "Q1463_19.svg", "Q1463_20.svg", "Q1463_21.svg", "Q1463_22.svg", "Q1463_23.svg", "Q1463_24.svg", "Q1463_25.svg", "Q1463_26.svg", "Q1463_27.png", "Q1463_28.jpg", "Q1463_29.svg", "Q1463_30.svg", "Q1463_31.svg", "Q1463_32.JPG", "Q1463_33.jpg", "Q1463_34.jpg", "Q1463_35.jpg", "Q1463_36.svg", "Q1463_37.jpg", "Q1463_38.jpg", "Q1463_39.jpg", "Q1463_40.svg", "Q1463_41.png", "Q1463_42.svg", "Q1463_43.svg", "Q1463_44.png", "Q1463_45.png", "Q1463_46.jpg", "Q1463_47.jpg", "Q1463_48.png", "Q1463_49.svg", "Q1463_50.png", "Q1463_51.jpg", "Q1463_52.svg", "Q1463_53.svg", "Q1463_54.svg", "Q1463_55.jpg", "Q1463_56.svg", "Q1463_57.svg", "Q1463_58.svg", "Q1463_59.svg", "Q1463_60.svg", "Q1463_61.svg", "Q1463_66.svg"], "summary": "Ferdinand Marcos:Sex: male.

She was the most prominent figure of the 1986 People Power Revolution, which ended the two-decade rule of President Ferdinand Marcos and led to the establishment of the current democratic Fifth Philippine Republic.\nCorazon Aquino was married to Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., who was one of the most prominent critics of President Marcos. After the assassination of her husband on 21 August 1983, she emerged as leader of the opposition against the president. In late 1985, Marcos called for a snap election, and Aquino ran for president with former Senator Salvador Laurel as her running mate for vice president. After the election held on 7 February 1986, the Batasang Pambansa proclaimed Marcos and his running mate Arturo Tolentino as the winners, which prompted allegations of electoral fraud and Aquino's call for massive civil disobedience actions. Subsequently, the People Power Revolution, a non-violent mass demonstration movement, took place from 22 February to 25 February. The People Power Revolution, along with defections from the Armed Forces of the Philippines and support from the Philippine Catholic Church, successfully ousted Marcos and secured Aquino's accession to the presidency on 25 February 1986. Prior to her election as president, Aquino had not held any elected office. She was the first female president of the Philippines.\nAs president, Aquino oversaw the drafting of the 1987 Constitution, which limited the powers of the Presidency and re-established the bicameral Congress, successfully removing the previous dictatorial government structure. Her economic policies focused on forging good economic standing amongst the international community as well as disestablishing Marcos-era crony capitalist monopolies, emphasizing the free market and responsible economy. Her administration conducted peace talks to resolve the Moro conflict, and the result of these talks was creation of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Aquino was also criticized for the Mendiola Massacre, which resulted in the shooting deaths of at least 12 peaceful protesters by Philippine state security forces. The Philippines faced various natural calamities in the latter part of Aquino's administration, such as the 1990 Luzon earthquake and Tropical Storm Thelma. Several coup attempts were made against her government. She was succeeded as president by Fidel V.

His extensive writings include treatises on rhetoric, philosophy and politics, and he is considered one of Rome's greatest orators and prose stylists. He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order, and served as consul in 63 BC.\nHis influence on the Latin language was immense. He wrote more than three-quarters of extant Latin literature that is known to have existed in his lifetime, and it has been said that subsequent prose was either a reaction against or a return to his style, not only in Latin but in European languages up to the 19th century. Cicero introduced into Latin the arguments of the chief schools of Hellenistic philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary with neologisms such as evidentia, humanitas, qualitas, quantitas, and essentia, distinguishing himself as a translator and philosopher.\nThough he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement. It was during his consulship that the second Catilinarian conspiracy attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators without trial. During the chaotic middle period of the 1st century BC, marked by civil wars and the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, Cicero championed a return to the traditional republican government. Following Caesar's death, Cicero became an enemy of Mark Antony in the ensuing power struggle, attacking him in a series of speeches. He was proscribed as an enemy of the state by the Second Triumvirate and consequently executed by soldiers operating on their behalf in 43 BC having been intercepted during an attempted flight from the Italian peninsula. His severed hands and head were then, as a final revenge of Mark Antony, displayed on the Rostra.\nPetrarch's rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century Renaissance in public affairs, humanism, and classical Roman culture. According to Polish historian Tadeusz Zieli\u0144ski, \"the Renaissance was above all things a revival of Cicero, and only after him and through him of the rest of Classical antiquity.\" The peak of Cicero's authority and prestige came during the 18th-century Enlightenment, and his impact on leading Enlightenment thinkers and political theorists such as John Locke, David Hume, Montesquieu and Edmund Burke was substantial. His works rank among the most influential in European culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the Roman Republic.", "img_list": ["Q1541_0.jpg", "Q1541_1.jpg", "Q1541_2.jpg", "Q1541_4.jpg", "Q1541_5.jpg", "Q1541_6.jpg", "Q1541_7.jpg", "Q1541_8.tif", "Q1541_9.jpg", "Q1541_10.svg", "Q1541_11.svg", "Q1541_12.svg", "Q1541_13.jpg", "Q1541_14.jpg", "Q1541_15.svg", "Q1541_16.svg"], "summary": "Cicero:Sex: male.

Hollande also served in the National Assembly twice for the first constituency of Corr\u00e8ze from 1988 to 1993 and again from 1997 until 2012.\nBorn in Rouen and raised in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hollande began his political career as a special advisor to newly elected President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, before serving as a staffer for Max Gallo, the government's spokesman. He became a member of the National Assembly in 1988 and was elected First Secretary of the Socialist Party in 1997. Following the 2004 regional elections won by the Socialists, Hollande was cited as a potential presidential candidate, but resigned as First Secretary and was immediately elected to replace Jean-Pierre Dupont as President of the General Council of Corr\u00e8ze in 2008. In 2011, Hollande announced that he would be a candidate in the primary election to select the Socialist Party presidential nominee; he won the nomination against Martine Aubry and was elected to the presidency on 6 May 2012 during the second round with 51.6% of the vote, defeating incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy.\nDuring his tenure, Hollande legalised same-sex marriage by passing Bill no. 344, reformed labour laws and credit training programmes, withdrew combat troops present in the Afghanistan military intervention and concluded an EU directive on the protection of animals in laboratory research through a Franco-German contract. Hollande led the country through the January and November 2015 Paris attacks, as well as the 2016 Nice truck attack. He was a leading proponent of EU mandatory migrant quotas and NATO's 2011 military intervention in Libya. He also sent troops to Mali and the Central African Republic with the approval of the UN Security Council in order to stabilise those countries, two operations largely seen as successful. However, his support of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen drew controversy among his left-wing electoral base.\nParis hosted the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference and Hollande's efforts to attract the 2024 Summer Olympics to the city were successful. Notwithstanding, with unemployment up to 10% and domestic troubles over his tenure due to terrorism, he faced spikes and downturns in approval rates, ultimately making him the most unpopular head of state under the Fifth Republic.

At the age of 25, he went from obscurity as a U.S. Air Mail pilot to instantaneous world fame by winning the Orteig Prize for making the first nonstop flight from New York City to Paris on May 20\u201321, 1927. Lindbergh covered the 33+1\u20442-hour, 3,600-statute-mile (5,800 km) flight alone in a purpose-built, single-engine Ryan monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis. Though the first non-stop transatlantic flight had been completed eight years earlier, this was the first solo transatlantic flight, the first transatlantic flight between two major city hubs, and the longest transatlantic flight by almost 2,000 miles. It is widely considered one of the most consequential flights in aviation history and ushered in a new era of transportation between parts of the globe.\nLindbergh was raised mostly in Little Falls, Minnesota and Washington, D.C., the son of prominent U.S. Congressman from Minnesota Charles August Lindbergh. He became an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps Reserve in 1924, earning the rank of second lieutenant in 1925. Later that year, he was hired as a U.S. Air Mail pilot in the Greater St. Louis area, where he started to prepare for his historic 1927 transatlantic flight. Lindbergh received the United States' highest military decoration from President Calvin Coolidge, the Medal of Honor, as well as the Distinguished Flying Cross for his transatlantic flight. The flight also earned him the highest French order of merit, civil or military, the Legion of Honour. His achievement spurred significant global interest in both commercial aviation and air mail, which revolutionized the aviation industry worldwide (described then as the \"Lindbergh boom\"), and he devoted much time and effort to promoting such activity. He was honored as Time's first \"Man of the Year\" in 1928, was appointed to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in 1929 by President Herbert Hoover, and was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal in 1930. In 1931, he and French surgeon Alexis Carrel began work on inventing the first perfusion pump, which is credited with making future heart surgeries and organ transplantation possible.\nOn March 1, 1932, Lindbergh's infant son, Charles Jr., was kidnapped and murdered in what the American media called the \"Crime of the Century.\" The case prompted the United States Congress to establish kidnapping as a federal crime if a kidnapper crosses state lines with a victim. By late 1935, the hysteria surrounding the case had driven the Lindbergh family into exile in Europe, from where they returned in 1939.\nIn the years before the United States entered World War II, Lindbergh's non-interventionist stance and statements about Jews and race led some to suspect he was a Nazi sympathizer, although Lindbergh never publicly stated support for Nazi Germany and on multiple occasions condemned them in both his public speeches and in his personal diary. However, early on in the war he opposed not only the intervention of the United States but also the provision of aid to the United Kingdom. He supported the antiwar America First Committee and resigned his commission in the U.S. Army Air Forces in April 1941 after President Franklin Roosevelt publicly rebuked him for his views. In September 1941, Lindbergh gave a significant address, titled \"Speech on Neutrality\", outlining his views and arguments against greater American involvement in the war.Lindbergh did ultimately express public support for the U.S. war effort after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the subsequent United States declaration of war upon Germany. He flew 50 missions in the Pacific Theater as a civilian consultant but did not take up arms, as Roosevelt refused to reinstate his Air Corps colonel's commission. In 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower restored his commission and promoted him to brigadier general in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. In his later years, Lindbergh became a prolific author, international explorer, inventor, and environmentalist, eventually dying of lymphoma in 1974 at age 72.", "img_list": ["Q1618_0.jpg", "Q1618_1.jpg", "Q1618_2.jpg", "Q1618_3.png", "Q1618_4.jpg", "Q1618_5.jpg", "Q1618_6.jpg", "Q1618_7.jpg", "Q1618_8.jpg", "Q1618_9.jpg", "Q1618_10.jpg", "Q1618_11.jpg", "Q1618_12.jpg", "Q1618_13.jpg", "Q1618_14.JPG", "Q1618_15.JPG", "Q1618_16.jpg", "Q1618_17.jpg", "Q1618_18.ogv", "Q1618_19.ogv", "Q1618_20.jpg", "Q1618_21.png", "Q1618_22.jpg", "Q1618_23.jpg", "Q1618_24.jpg", "Q1618_25.svg", "Q1618_26.png", "Q1618_27.jpg", "Q1618_28.svg", "Q1618_29.jpg", "Q1618_30.jpg", "Q1618_31.jpg", "Q1618_32.jpg", "Q1618_33.jpg", "Q1618_34.jpg", "Q1618_35.JPG", "Q1618_36.jpg", "Q1618_37.svg", "Q1618_38.svg", "Q1618_39.svg", "Q1618_40.jpg", "Q1618_41.jpg", "Q1618_42.JPG", "Q1618_43.svg", "Q1618_44.jpg", "Q1618_45.jpg", "Q1618_46.svg"], "summary": "Charles Lindbergh:Sex: male.

His short reign was conspicuous for sex scandals and religious controversy. A close relative to the Severan dynasty, he came from a prominent Arab family in Emesa (Homs), Syria, where since his early youth he served as head priest of the sun god Elagabal. After the death of his cousin the emperor Caracalla,  Elagabalus was raised to the principate at 14 years of age in an army revolt instigated by his grandmother Julia Maesa against Caracalla's short-lived successor, Macrinus. As a private citizen, he was probably named Varius Avitus Bassianus. Upon becoming emperor he took the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and only posthumously became known by the Latinised name of his god.Later historians suggest Elagabalus showed a disregard for Roman religious traditions and sexual taboos. He replaced the traditional head of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter, with the deity Elagabal, of whom he had been high priest. He forced leading members of Rome's government to participate in religious rites celebrating this deity, presiding over them in person. He married four women, including a Vestal Virgin, and lavished favours on male courtiers thought to have been his lovers. He was also reported to have prostituted himself. His behavior estranged the Praetorian Guard, the Senate, and the common people alike. Amidst growing opposition, at just 18 years of age he was assassinated and replaced by his cousin Severus Alexander in March 222. The assassination plot against Elagabalus was devised by Julia Maesa, his grandmother, and carried out by disaffected members of the Praetorian Guard.\nElagabalus developed a reputation among his contemporaries for extreme eccentricity, decadence, zealotry, and sexual promiscuity. This tradition has persisted, and among  writers of the early modern age he suffered one of the worst reputations among Roman emperors. Edward Gibbon, for example, wrote that Elagabalus \"abandoned himself to the grossest pleasures with ungoverned fury\". According to Barthold Georg Niebuhr, \"the name Elagabalus is branded in history above all others\" because of his \"unspeakably disgusting life\". An example of a modern historian's assessment is Adrian Goldsworthy's: \"Elagabalus was not a tyrant, but he was an incompetent, probably the least able emperor Rome had ever had.\" Despite universal condemnation of his reign, some scholars write warmly about him, including 6th century Roman chronicler John Malalas, and Warwick Ball, a modern historian who described him as innovative and \"a tragic enigma lost behind centuries of prejudice\".", "img_list": ["Q1762_0.png", "Q1762_1.jpg", "Q1762_2.jpg", "Q1762_3.jpg", "Q1762_4.jpg", "Q1762_5.jpg", "Q1762_6.png", "Q1762_7.png", "Q1762_8.png", "Q1762_9.png", "Q1762_10.png", "Q1762_11.jpg", "Q1762_12.jpg", "Q1762_13.jpg", "Q1762_14.jpg", "Q1762_15.svg", "Q1762_19.jpg"], "summary": "Elagabalus:Sex: male.

He was the last emperor from the Severan dynasty. He succeeded his slain cousin Elagabalus in 222. Alexander himself was eventually assassinated, and his death marked the beginning of the events of the Third Century Crisis, which included nearly fifty years of civil war, foreign invasion, and the collapse of the monetary economy.\nAlexander was the heir to his cousin, the 18-year-old Emperor Elagabalus. The latter had been murdered along with his mother Julia Soaemias by his own guards, who, as a mark of contempt, had their remains cast into the Tiber river. Alexander and his cousin were both grandsons of Julia Maesa, the sister of empress Julia Domna, who had arranged for Elagabalus's acclamation as emperor by the Third Gallic Legion.\nAlexander's 13-year reign was the longest reign of a sole emperor since Antoninus Pius. He was also the second-youngest ever sole legal Roman emperor during the existence of the united empire, the youngest being Gordian III. Alexander's peacetime reign was prosperous. However, Rome was militarily confronted with the rising Sassanid Empire and growing incursions from the tribes of Germania. He managed to check the threat of the Sassanids. But when campaigning against Germanic tribes, Alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery. This alienated many in the Roman army, leading to a conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of Alexander, his mother Julia Avita Mamaea, and his advisors. After their deaths, the accession of Maximinus Thrax followed.

He is among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and different eras in the history of jazz.Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe \"King\" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. In Chicago, he spent time with other popular jazz musicians, reconnecting with his friend Bix Beiderbecke and spending time with Hoagy Carmichael and Lil Hardin. He earned a reputation at \"cutting contests\" and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson.  Henderson persuaded Armstrong to come to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist.  Hardin became Armstrong's second wife and they returned to Chicago to play together and then he began to form his own \"Hot\" jazz bands.  After years of touring, he settled in Queens, and by the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, assisted in part, by his appearances on radio and in film and television, in addition to his concerts.\nWith his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at scat singing. Armstrong is renowned for his charismatic stage presence and voice as well as his trumpet playing. By the end of Armstrong's life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to \"cross over\" to wide popularity with white (and international) audiences. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men.\nArmstrong appeared in films such as High Society (1956) alongside Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra, and Hello, Dolly! (1969) starring Barbra Streisand. He received many accolades including three Grammy Award nominations and a win for his vocal performance of Hello, Dolly! in 1964.

Aznavour was known for his distinctive vibrato tenor voice: clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with gravelly and profound low notes. In a career as a composer, singer and songwriter, spanning over 70 years, he recorded more than 1,200 songs interpreted in 9 languages. Moreover, he wrote or co-wrote more than 1,000 songs for himself and others. Aznavour is regarded as one of the greatest songwriters in the history of music and an icon of 20th-century pop culture.One of France's most popular and enduring singers,. He was dubbed France's Frank Sinatra, while music critic Stephen Holden described Aznavour as a \"French pop deity\". He was also arguably the most famous Armenian of his time. In 1998, Aznavour was named Entertainer of the Century by CNN and users of Time Online from around the globe. He was recognized as the century's outstanding performer, with nearly 18% of the total vote, edging out Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. Jean Cocteau once said: \"Before Aznavour despair was unpopular\".Aznavour sang for presidents, popes and royalty, as well as at humanitarian events. In response to the 1988 Armenian earthquake, he founded the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time friend impresario Levon Sayan.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Witney from 2001 to 2016 and leader of the Conservative Party from 2005 to 2016. He identifies as a one-nation conservative, and has been associated with both economically liberal and socially liberal policies.\nBorn in London to an upper-middle-class family, Cameron was educated at Heatherdown School, Eton College, and Brasenose College, Oxford. From 1988 to 1993 he worked at the Conservative Research Department, latterly assisting the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, before leaving politics to work for Carlton Communications in 1994. Becoming an MP in 2001, he served in the opposition shadow cabinet under Conservative leader Michael Howard, and succeeded Howard in 2005. Cameron sought to rebrand the Conservatives, embracing an increasingly socially liberal and centrist position. Following the 2010 general election, negotiations led to Cameron becoming prime minister as the head of a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats \u2013 the youngest holder of the office since the 1810s. His premiership was marked by the ongoing effects of the late-2000s financial crisis; these involved a large deficit in government finances that his government sought to reduce through austerity measures. His administration passed the Health and Social Care Act and the Welfare Reform Act, which introduced large-scale changes to healthcare and welfare. He also enforced stricter immigration policies, introduced reforms to education and oversaw the 2012 London Olympics. It privatised the Royal Mail and some other state assets, and legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales.\nInternationally, Cameron's government intervened militarily in the First Libyan Civil War and authorised the bombing of the Islamic State. Domestically, his government oversaw the referendum on voting reform and Scottish independence referendum, both of which confirmed Cameron's favoured outcome. When the Conservatives secured an unexpected majority in the 2015 general election, he remained as prime minister, this time leading a Conservative-only government. To fulfil a manifesto pledge, he introduced a referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EU. Cameron supported continued membership; following the success of the Leave vote, he resigned to make way for a new prime minister and was succeeded by Theresa May. Cameron has been the President of Alzheimer's Research UK since 2017.Cameron has been praised for modernising the Conservative Party and for decreasing the United Kingdom's national deficit. However, he has been criticised for his decision to hold the referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, which led to political instability in the UK during the late 2010s. He has also been accused of elitism and political opportunism.

In 1958, he came out of retirement when appointed President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) by President Ren\u00e9 Coty. He rewrote the Constitution of France and founded the Fifth Republic after approval by referendum. He was elected President of France later that year, a position to which he was reelected in 1965 and held until his resignation in 1969.\nBorn in Lille, he graduated from Saint-Cyr in 1912. He was a decorated officer of the First World War, wounded several times and later taken prisoner at Verdun. During the interwar period, he advocated mobile armoured divisions. During the German invasion of May 1940, he led an armoured division which counterattacked the invaders; he was then appointed Undersecretary for War. Refusing to accept his government's armistice with Germany, de Gaulle fled to England and exhorted the French to resist occupation and to continue the fight in his Appeal of 18 June. He led the Free French Forces and later headed the French National Liberation Committee against the Axis. Despite frosty relations with the United States, he generally had Winston Churchill's support and emerged as the undisputed leader of Free France. He became head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic in June 1944, the interim government of France following its liberation. As early as 1944, de Gaulle introduced a dirigiste economic policy, which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth, known as the Trente Glorieuses. Frustrated by the return of petty partisanship in the new Fourth Republic, he resigned in early 1946 but continued to be politically active as founder of the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (RPF; \"Rally of the French People\"). He retired in the early 1950s and wrote his War Memoirs, which quickly became a staple of modern French literature.\nWhen the Algerian War was ripping apart the unstable Fourth Republic, the National Assembly brought him back to power during the May 1958 crisis. He founded the Fifth Republic with a strong presidency, and he was elected to continue in that role. He managed to keep France together while taking steps to end the war, much to the anger of the Pieds-Noirs (ethnic French born in Algeria) and the military; both previously had supported his return to power to maintain colonial rule. He granted independence to Algeria and acted progressively towards other French colonies. In the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle initiated his \"politics of grandeur\" asserting that France as a major power should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for its national security and prosperity. To this end, he pursued a policy of \"national independence\" which led him to withdraw from NATO's military integrated command and to launch an independent nuclear development program that made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the Anglo-American and Soviet spheres of influence through the signing of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty on 22 January 1963.\nHowever, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring Europe as a continent of sovereign nations. De Gaulle openly criticised the United States intervention in Vietnam and the \"exorbitant privilege\" of the United States dollar. In his later years, his support for the slogan \"Vive le Qu\u00e9bec libre\" and his two vetoes of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community generated considerable controversy in both North America and Europe. Although reelected to the presidency in 1965, he faced widespread protests by students and workers in May 1968, but had the Army's support and won an election with an increased majority in the National Assembly. De Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralisation. He died a year later at his residence in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, leaving his presidential memoirs unfinished.\nMany French political parties and figures claim a Gaullist legacy; many streets and monuments in France were dedicated to his memory after his death.", "img_list": ["Q2042_0.jpg", "Q2042_1.jpg", "Q2042_2.jpg", "Q2042_3.png", "Q2042_4.png", "Q2042_5.png", "Q2042_6.png", "Q2042_7.svg", "Q2042_8.jpg", "Q2042_9.jpg", "Q2042_10.JPG", "Q2042_11.svg", "Q2042_12.jpg", "Q2042_13.jpg", "Q2042_14.jpg", "Q2042_15.jpg", "Q2042_16.jpg", "Q2042_17.jpg", "Q2042_18.jpg", "Q2042_19.svg", "Q2042_20.jpg", "Q2042_21.jpg", "Q2042_22.jpg", "Q2042_23.svg", "Q2042_24.svg", "Q2042_25.svg", "Q2042_26.svg", "Q2042_27.png", "Q2042_28.jpg", "Q2042_29.jpg", "Q2042_30.jpg", "Q2042_31.jpg", "Q2042_32.jpg", "Q2042_33.jpg", "Q2042_34.jpg", "Q2042_35.svg", "Q2042_36.png", "Q2042_37.jpg", "Q2042_38.svg", "Q2042_39.jpg", "Q2042_40.ogg", "Q2042_41.jpg", "Q2042_42.svg", "Q2042_43.svg", "Q2042_44.png", "Q2042_45.jpg", "Q2042_46.jpg", "Q2042_47.jpg", "Q2042_48.png", "Q2042_49.JPEG", "Q2042_50.jpg", "Q2042_51.svg", "Q2042_52.jpg", "Q2042_53.png", "Q2042_54.svg", "Q2042_55.jpg", "Q2042_56.svg", "Q2042_57.svg", "Q2042_58.jpg", "Q2042_59.png", "Q2042_60.png", "Q2042_61.jpg", "Q2042_62.svg", "Q2042_63.svg", "Q2042_64.svg", "Q2042_65.png", "Q2042_66.png", "Q2042_67.gif", "Q2042_68.svg", "Q2042_69.svg", "Q2042_70.gif", "Q2042_71.gif", "Q2042_72.png", "Q2042_73.gif", "Q2042_74.png", "Q2042_75.gif", "Q2042_76.png", "Q2042_77.svg", "Q2042_78.svg", "Q2042_79.svg", "Q2042_80.png", "Q2042_81.png", "Q2042_82.svg", "Q2042_83.svg", "Q2042_84.png", "Q2042_85.svg", "Q2042_86.png", "Q2042_87.jpg", "Q2042_88.jpg", "Q2042_89.png", "Q2042_90.PNG", "Q2042_91.jpg", "Q2042_92.svg", "Q2042_93.jpg", "Q2042_94.jpg", "Q2042_95.JPG", "Q2042_96.png", "Q2042_97.svg", "Q2042_98.png", "Q2042_99.png", "Q2042_100.svg", "Q2042_101.svg", "Q2042_102.svg", "Q2042_103.jpg", "Q2042_104.svg", "Q2042_108.jpg"], "summary": "Charles de Gaulle:Sex: male.

Harper won three mandates during his nearly decade-long tenure, and is the first and only prime minister to come from the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada, serving as the party's first leader from 2004 to 2015.\nHarper studied economics, earning a bachelor's degree in 1985 and a master's degree in 1991. He was one of the founders of the Reform Party of Canada and was first elected in 1993 in Calgary West. He did not seek re-election in the 1997 federal election, instead joining and later leading the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative lobbyist group. In 2002, he succeeded Stockwell Day as leader of the Canadian Alliance, the successor to the Reform Party, and returned to parliament as leader of the Official Opposition. In 2003, Harper negotiated the merger of the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada to form the Conservative Party of Canada and was elected as the party's first leader in March 2004. In the 2004 federal election, the new party lost its first election to the Liberal Party led by Paul Martin. From 2002 to 2015 as party leader, leader of the Official Opposition, and then prime minister, Harper represented the riding of Calgary Southwest in Alberta. He represented Calgary Heritage from 2015 until 2016.The 2006 federal election resulted in a minority government led by the Conservative Party with Harper becoming the 22nd prime minister of Canada. During his first term, Harper confronted the In and Out scandal, while major legislation passed under Harper's leadership included the Federal Accountability Act, the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois nation motion and the Veterans' Bill of Rights. After the 2008 federal election, in which the Conservative Party won a larger minority, Harper passed the Economic Action Plan in response to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, prorogued Parliament to defeat a non-confidence motion by a potential coalition of opposition parties and ordered military intervention during the First Libyan Civil War. The 40th Canadian Parliament was eventually dissolved in March 2011, after another no-confidence vote that found his government to be in contempt of Parliament. In the federal election, the Conservatives won a majority government. During his third term, Harper withdrew Canada from the Kyoto Protocol, launched Operation Impact in opposition to ISIL, repealed the long-gun registry, passed the Anti-terrorism Act, 2015, launched Canada's Global Markets Action Plan and grappled with controversies surrounding the Canadian Senate expenses scandal and the Robocall scandal.\nIn the 2015 federal election, the Conservative Party lost power to the Liberal Party led by Justin Trudeau. Harper officially stepped down as party leader on October 19, 2015, and Rona Ambrose was subsequently chosen as interim leader on November 5, 2015.

A recipient of an Academy Honorary Award in 2019, Lynch has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Director, and the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Foreign Film twice, as well as the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Lion award for lifetime achievement at the Venice Film Festival. In 2007, a panel of critics convened by The Guardian announced that 'after all the discussion, no one could fault the conclusion that David Lynch is the most important film-maker of the current era', while AllMovie called him \"the Renaissance man of modern American filmmaking\". His work led to him being labeled \"the first populist surrealist\" by film critic Pauline Kael.Lynch studied painting before he began making short films in the late 1960s. His first feature-length film, the surrealist Eraserhead (1977), became a success on the midnight movie circuit, and he followed that by directing The Elephant Man (1980), Dune (1984), and Blue Velvet (1986). Lynch next created his own television series with Mark Frost, the murder mystery Twin Peaks (1990\u201391), which ran for two seasons. He also made the film prequel Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992), the road film Wild at Heart (1990), and the family film The Straight Story (1999) in the same period. Turning further towards surrealist filmmaking, three of his subsequent films operated on dream logic non-linear narrative structures: Lost Highway (1997), Mulholland Drive (2001), and Inland Empire (2006).

Bush", "answer": "Q207", "brief": "George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman who served as the 43rd president of the United States from 2001 to 2009. A member of the Bush family and Republican Party, he previously served as the 46th governor of Texas from 1995 to 2000.\nWhile in his twenties, Bush flew warplanes in the Texas Air National Guard. After graduating from Harvard Business School in 1975, he worked in the oil industry. In 1978, Bush unsuccessfully ran for the House of Representatives. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before he was elected governor of Texas in 1994. As governor, Bush successfully sponsored legislation for tort reform, increased education funding, set higher standards for schools, and reformed the criminal justice system. He also helped make Texas the leading producer of wind powered electricity in the nation. In the 2000 presidential election, Bush defeated Democratic incumbent Vice President Al Gore after a narrow and contested win that involved a Supreme Court decision to stop a recount in Florida. He became the fourth person to be elected president without a popular vote victory.\nUpon taking office, Bush signed a major tax cut program and education reform bill, the No Child Left Behind Act. He pushed for socially conservative efforts such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and faith-based initiatives. A decisive event that reshaped his administration were the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, resulting in the creation of the Department of Homeland Security and war on terror. Bush ordered an invasion of Afghanistan, beginning the War in Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban, destroy al-Qaeda, and capture Osama bin Laden. He signed the Patriot Act in order to authorize surveillance of suspected terrorists. In 2003, Bush ordered an invasion of Iraq which began the Iraq War, falsely arguing that the Saddam Hussein regime possessed weapons of mass destruction. Bush also signed the Medicare Modernization Act, creating Medicare Part D and funding for PEPFAR.\nBush was re-elected president in 2004, defeating Democrat John Kerry. During his second term, Bush reached multiple free trade agreements. He appointed John Roberts and Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. He sought major changes to Social Security and immigration laws, but both efforts failed in Congress. Bush was widely criticized for his handling of Hurricane Katrina and the midterm dismissal of U.S. attorneys. In the midst of his unpopularity, the Democrats regained control of Congress in the 2006 elections. The Afghanistan and Iraq wars continued and in January 2007, Bush launched a surge of troops in Iraq. By December, the U.S. entered the Great Recession, prompting the Bush administration to obtain congressional approval for multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system including the Troubled Asset Relief Program.\nAfter finishing his second term, Bush returned to Texas, where his presidential library opened in 2013. He was among the most popular and unpopular presidents in U.S. history, having received the highest recorded approval ratings in the wake of the September 11 attacks, but one of the lowest such ratings during the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis. Bush's presidency has been rated as below-average, although public and scholarly favorability of his presidency have improved since leaving office.", "img_list": ["Q207_0.jpg", "Q207_1.jpg", "Q207_2.svg", "Q207_3.svg", "Q207_5.jpg", "Q207_6.jpg", "Q207_7.png", "Q207_8.svg", "Q207_9.svg", "Q207_10.svg", "Q207_11.jpg", "Q207_12.svg", "Q207_13.jpg", "Q207_14.jpeg", "Q207_15.png", "Q207_16.svg", "Q207_17.jpg", "Q207_18.jpg", "Q207_20.jpg", "Q207_21.svg", "Q207_22.jpg", "Q207_23.svg", "Q207_24.jpg", "Q207_25.jpg", "Q207_27.jpg", "Q207_29.jpg", "Q207_30.svg", "Q207_31.svg", "Q207_32.svg", "Q207_33.jpg", "Q207_35.svg", "Q207_36.svg", "Q207_37.svg", "Q207_38.jpg", "Q207_48.jpg"], "summary": "George W.

He was a multitalented racer who competed in motorcycle racing before switching to cars. Ascari won consecutive world titles in 1952 and 1953 for Scuderia Ferrari. He was the team's first World Champion and the last Italian to date to win the title. This was sandwiched by an appearance in the 1952 Indianapolis 500. Ascari also won the Mille Miglia in 1954.

Chirac was previously Prime Minister of France from 1974 to 1976 and from 1986 to 1988, as well as Mayor of Paris from 1977 to 1995.\nAfter attending the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration, Chirac began his career as a high-level civil servant, entering politics shortly thereafter. Chirac occupied various senior positions, including Minister of Agriculture and Minister of the Interior. In 1981 and 1988, he unsuccessfully ran for President as the standard-bearer for the conservative Gaullist party Rally for the Republic. Chirac's internal policies initially included lower tax rates, the removal of price controls, strong punishment for crime and terrorism, and business privatisation. After pursuing these policies in his second term as Prime Minister, he changed his views. He argued for different economic policies and was elected president in the 1995 presidential election with 52.6% of the vote in the second round, beating Socialist Lionel Jospin, after campaigning on a platform of healing the \"social rift\" (fracture sociale). Then, Chirac's economic policies, based on dirigisme, allowing for state-directed investment, stood in opposition to the laissez-faire policies of the United Kingdom under the ministries of Margaret Thatcher and John Major, which Chirac described as \"Anglo-Saxon ultraliberalism\".He was also known for his stand against the American-led invasion of Iraq, his recognition of the collaborationist French Government's role in deporting Jews, and his reduction of the presidential term from 7 years to 5 through a referendum in 2000. At the 2002 French presidential election, he won 82.2% of the vote in the second round against the far-right candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen.

Appointed by the Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army, Washington led the Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War, and presided at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which established the Constitution of the United States and a federal government. Washington has been called the \"Father of the Nation\" for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the country.\nWashington's first public office was serving as official Surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia from 1749 to 1750. Subsequently, he received his initial military training (as well as a command with the Virginia Regiment) during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress. Here he was appointed Commanding General of the Continental Army. With this title, he commanded American forces (allied with France) in the defeat and surrender of the British at the Siege of Yorktown during the American Revolutionary War. He resigned his commission after the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783.\nWashington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution of the United States. He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously. As president, he implemented a strong, well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including the title \"Mr. President\", and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent statement on republicanism.\nWashington controlled over 577 slaves in his lifetime, who worked on his farm  and in his houses. He signed measures passed by Congress to protect slavery, as well as measures passed by Congress to curtail slavery. He became troubled with the institution of slavery during the 1770s, and in his will he stipulated that one of his slaves, William Lee, should be freed upon his death, along with 33 more slaves that he acquired in a prior debt agreement with his brother-in-law. He also stipulated that the other 123 slaves that he owned should be freed upon the death of his wife, Martha Washington. She however freed them on January 1, 1801, during her lifetime.He endeavored to assimilate Native Americans into the Anglo-American culture but fought indigenous resistance during instances of violent conflict. He was a member of the Anglican Church and the Freemasons, and he urged broad religious freedom in his roles as general and president. Upon his death, he was eulogized by Henry \u201cLight-Horse Harry\u201d Lee as \"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen\".Washington has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media, geographical locations, including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency, and many scholars and polls rank him among the greatest U.S. presidents. In 1976, as part of commemorations for the U.S. Bicentennial, Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies of the United States.", "img_list": ["Q23_0.jpeg", "Q23_1.png", "Q23_2.jpg", "Q23_3.jpg", "Q23_4.jpg", "Q23_5.jpg", "Q23_6.svg", "Q23_7.jpg", "Q23_9.jpg", "Q23_11.jpg", "Q23_12.svg", "Q23_13.svg", "Q23_14.svg", "Q23_15.svg", "Q23_16.jpg", "Q23_17.jpg", "Q23_18.jpg", "Q23_19.jpg", "Q23_20.png", "Q23_21.jpg", "Q23_22.svg", "Q23_23.jpg", "Q23_24.jpg", "Q23_25.jpg", "Q23_26.jpg", "Q23_27.jpg", "Q23_28.jpg", "Q23_29.jpg", "Q23_30.jpg", "Q23_31.jpg", "Q23_32.jpg", "Q23_33.jpg", "Q23_34.svg", "Q23_35.jpg", "Q23_36.svg", "Q23_37.jpg", "Q23_38.jpg", "Q23_39.jpg", "Q23_40.jpg", "Q23_41.jpg", "Q23_42.jpg", "Q23_43.jpg", "Q23_44.jpg", "Q23_45.jpg", "Q23_46.jpg", "Q23_47.jpg", "Q23_48.jpg", "Q23_49.jpg", "Q23_50.jpg", "Q23_51.svg", "Q23_52.svg", "Q23_53.svg", "Q23_54.svg", "Q23_56.jpg", "Q23_58.jpg", "Q23_60.jpg", "Q23_63.jpg", "Q23_69.jpeg", "Q23_70.jpg"], "summary": "George Washington:Sex: male.

From 1946 to 1966, he was the first leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a Christian democratic party he co-founded, which under his leadership became the dominant force in the country.\nA devout Roman Catholic and member of the Catholic Centre Party, Adenauer was a leading politician in the Weimar Republic, serving as Mayor of Cologne (1917\u20131933) and as president of the Prussian State Council (1922\u20131933). In the early years of the Federal Republic, he switched focus from denazification to recovery, and led his country from the ruins of World War II to becoming a productive and prosperous nation that forged close relations with France, the United Kingdom and the United States. During his years in power, West Germany achieved democracy, stability, international respect and economic prosperity (Wirtschaftswunder, German for \"economic miracle\").Adenauer belied his age by his intense work habits and his uncanny political instinct. He displayed a strong dedication to a broad vision of market-based liberal democracy and anti-communism. A shrewd and strategic politician, Adenauer was deeply committed to a Western-oriented foreign policy and restoring the position of West Germany on the world stage. He worked to restore the West German economy from the destruction of World War II to a central position in Europe, presiding over the German economic miracle together with his Minister of Economics, Ludwig Erhard, and was a driving force in re-establishing national military forces (the Bundeswehr) and intelligence services (the Bundesnachrichtendienst) in West Germany in 1955 and 1956. Adenauer opposed recognition of the rival German Democratic Republic or the Oder-Neisse line. He skillfully used these points in electoral campaigns against the SPD, which was more sympathetic to co-existence with the GDR and the post-war borders. Adenauer made West Germany a member of NATO. Although also a proponent of European unity, Adenauer pursued strong Atlanticist links with the United States as a counterbalance to France.\nAdenauer, who resigned as Chancellor at the age of 87 and remained head of the governing CDU until his retirement at 90, was often dubbed \"Der Alte\" (\"the old one\"). According to British historian Roy Jenkins, he was \"the oldest statesman ever to function in elected office\" and the oldest head of government of a major country in modern European history. As of 2021, Adenauer remains the oldest-ever European head of government; however, the governments of Tunisia and Malaysia had older leaders during the 2010s.", "img_list": ["Q2492_0.JPG", "Q2492_1.jpg", "Q2492_2.jpg", "Q2492_3.svg", "Q2492_4.svg", "Q2492_5.jpg", "Q2492_6.jpg", "Q2492_7.jpg", "Q2492_8.jpg", "Q2492_9.jpg", "Q2492_10.jpg", "Q2492_11.jpg", "Q2492_12.jpg", "Q2492_13.jpg", "Q2492_14.jpg", "Q2492_15.jpg", "Q2492_16.jpg", "Q2492_17.jpg", "Q2492_18.jpg", "Q2492_19.jpg", "Q2492_20.JPG", "Q2492_21.svg", "Q2492_22.svg", "Q2492_23.svg", "Q2492_24.ogg", "Q2492_25.svg", "Q2492_26.svg", "Q2492_27.svg", "Q2492_28.svg", "Q2492_29.svg", "Q2492_30.svg", "Q2492_31.svg", "Q2492_32.svg", "Q2492_33.svg", "Q2492_34.svg", "Q2492_35.svg", "Q2492_36.svg", "Q2492_37.svg", "Q2492_38.svg", "Q2492_39.svg", "Q2492_40.svg", "Q2492_41.svg", "Q2492_42.svg", "Q2492_43.svg", "Q2492_44.jpg", "Q2492_45.jpg", "Q2492_46.JPG", "Q2492_47.png", "Q2492_48.svg", "Q2492_49.jpg", "Q2492_50.jpg", "Q2492_51.svg", "Q2492_59.svg"], "summary": "Konrad Adenauer:Sex: male.

He was the first Social Democrat chancellor since 1930.\nFleeing to Norway and then Sweden during the Nazi regime and working as a left-wing journalist, he took the name Willy Brandt as a pseudonym to avoid detection by Nazi agents, and then formally adopted the name in 1948.

He served as the foreign minister and as the vice-chancellor in Kurt Georg Kiesinger's cabinet, and became chancellor in 1969.\nAs chancellor, he maintained West Germany's close alignment with the United States and focused on strengthening European integration in western Europe, while launching the new policy of Ostpolitik aimed at improving relations with Eastern Europe.

He was an energetic diplomat who sought European co-operation and international economic co-ordination and was the leading force in creating the European Monetary System in 1978. He was re-elected chancellor in 1976 and 1980, but his coalition fell apart in 1982 with the switch by his coalition allies, the Free Democratic Party.\nHe retired from Parliament in 1986, after clashing with the SPD's left wing, who opposed him on defence and economic issues.

Kohl's 16-year tenure is the longest of any German chancellor since Otto von Bismarck, and oversaw the end of the Cold War, the German reunification and the creation of the European Union (EU). \nBorn in 1930 in Ludwigshafen to a Catholic family, Kohl joined the CDU in 1946 at the age of 16. He earned a PhD in history at Heidelberg University in 1958, and worked as a business executive before becoming a full-time politician. He was elected as the youngest member of the Parliament of Rhineland-Palatinate in 1959 and from 1969 to 1976 was minister president of the Rhineland-Palatinate state. Viewed during the 1960s and the early 1970s as a progressive within the CDU, he was elected national chairman of the party in 1973. After he had become party leader, Kohl was increasingly seen as a more conservative figure. In the 1976 and 1980 federal elections his party performed well, but the social-liberal government of social democrat Helmut Schmidt was able to remain in power. After Schmidt had lost the support of the liberal FDP in 1982, Kohl was elected Chancellor through a constructive vote of no confidence, forming a coalition government with the FDP. Kohl chaired the G7 in 1985 and 1992.\nAs Chancellor, Kohl was committed to European integration and especially to the Franco-German relationship; he was also a steadfast ally of the United States and supported Ronald Reagan's more aggressive policies to weaken the Soviet Union. Following the Revolutions of 1989, his government acted decisively, culminating in the German reunification in 1990. Kohl and French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand were the architects of the Maastricht Treaty which established the EU and the Euro currency. Kohl was also a central figure in the eastern enlargement of the EU, and his government led the effort to push for international recognition of Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina when the states declared independence. He played an instrumental role in resolving the Bosnian War. Domestically Kohl's policies from 1990 focused on integrating former East Germany into reunified Germany, and he moved the federal capital from the \"provisional capital\" Bonn back to Berlin, although he never resided there because the government offices were only relocated in 1999. Kohl also greatly increased federal spending on arts and culture. After his chancellorship, Kohl became honorary chairman of the CDU in 1998 but resigned from the position in 2000 in the wake of the CDU donations scandal which damaged his reputation domestically.\nKohl received the 1988 Charlemagne Prize and was named Honorary Citizen of Europe by the European Council in 1998. Following his death, Kohl was honoured with the first-ever European act of state in Strasbourg. Kohl was described as \"the greatest European leader of the second half of the 20th century\" by US presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton.", "img_list": ["Q2518_0.jpg", "Q2518_1.svg", "Q2518_2.svg", "Q2518_3.jpg", "Q2518_4.jpg", "Q2518_5.jpg", "Q2518_6.jpg", "Q2518_7.jpg", "Q2518_8.jpg", "Q2518_9.jpg", "Q2518_10.jpg", "Q2518_11.jpg", "Q2518_12.jpg", "Q2518_13.jpg", "Q2518_14.jpg", "Q2518_15.svg", "Q2518_16.ogg", "Q2518_17.svg", "Q2518_18.svg", "Q2518_19.jpg", "Q2518_20.svg", "Q2518_21.svg", "Q2518_22.svg", "Q2518_23.svg", "Q2518_24.svg", "Q2518_25.JPG", "Q2518_26.jpg", "Q2518_27.jpg", "Q2518_28.PNG", "Q2518_29.jpg", "Q2518_30.svg", "Q2518_31.jpg", "Q2518_32.jpg", "Q2518_33.jpg", "Q2518_34.jpg", "Q2518_35.svg", "Q2518_36.svg", "Q2518_37.svg", "Q2518_38.jpg", "Q2518_39.svg", "Q2518_40.svg", "Q2518_41.jpg", "Q2518_42.svg"], "summary": "Helmut Kohl:Sex: male.

A former Lutheran pastor, he came to prominence as an anti-communist civil rights activist in East Germany.During the Peaceful Revolution in 1989, he was a co-founder of the New Forum opposition movement in East Germany, which contributed to the downfall of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and later with two other movements formed the electoral list Alliance 90. In 1990 he was a member of the only freely elected East German People's Chamber in the Alliance 90/The Greens faction. Following German reunification, he was elected as a member of the Bundestag by the People's Chamber in 1990 but resigned after a single day having been chosen by the Bundestag to be the first Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records, serving from 1990 to 2000.

He held the posts of General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) and Chairman of the National Defence Council; in 1976, he replaced Willi Stoph as Chairman of the State Council, the official head of state. As the leader of East Germany, Honecker had close ties to the Soviet Union, which maintained a large army in the country.\nHonecker's political career began in the 1930s when he became an official of the Communist Party of Germany, a position for which he was imprisoned by the Nazis. Following World War II, he was freed by the Soviet army and relaunched his political activities, founding the SED's youth organisation, the Free German Youth, in 1946 and serving as the group's chairman until 1955. As the Security Secretary of the SED Central Committee, he was the prime organiser of the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 and, in this function, bore administrative responsibility for the \"order to fire\" along the Wall and the larger inner German border.\nIn 1970, Honecker initiated a political power struggle that led, with support of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, to his replacing Walter Ulbricht as General Secretary of the SED and chairman of the National Defence Council. Under his command, the country adopted a programme of \"consumer socialism\" and moved towards the international community by normalizing relations with West Germany and also becoming a full member of the UN, in what is considered one of his greatest political successes.\nAs Cold War tensions eased in the late 1980s with the advent of perestroika and glasnost\u2014the liberal reforms introduced by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev\u2014Honecker refused all but cosmetic changes to the East German political system. He cited the continual hardliner attitudes of Kim Il-sung and Fidel Castro, whose respective regimes of North Korea and Cuba had been critical of reforms. As anti-government protests grew, Honecker begged Gorbachev to intervene with the Soviet army to suppress the protests to maintain communist rule in East Germany as Moscow had done with Czechoslovakia in the Prague Spring of 1968 and with the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, but Gorbachev refused. Honecker was forced to resign by the SED Politburo in October 1989 in a bid to improve the government's image in the eyes of the public; the effort was unsuccessful, and the regime would collapse entirely the following month.\nFollowing German reunification in 1990, Honecker sought asylum in the Chilean embassy in Moscow, but was extradited back to Germany in 1992, after the fall of the Soviet Union, to stand trial for his role in the human rights abuses committed by the East German government. However, the proceedings were abandoned, as Honecker was suffering from terminal liver cancer.

Ulbricht played a leading role in the creation of the Weimar-era Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and later (after spending the years of Nazi rule in exile in France and the Soviet Union) in the early development and establishment of the German Democratic Republic. As the First Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party from 1950 to 1971, he was the chief decision-maker in East Germany. From President Wilhelm Pieck's death in 1960 on, he was also the East German head of state until his own death in 1973. As the firm leader of the strongest and most important Communist satellite, Ulbricht had a degree of bargaining power with the Kremlin that he used effectively.  For example, he demanded the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 when the Kremlin was reluctant.Ulbricht began his political life during the German Empire, when he joined first the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1912, the anti-World War I Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) in 1917 and deserted the Imperial German Army in 1918. He joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1920 and became a leading party functionary, serving in its Central Committee from 1923 onward. After the Nazi takeover of Germany in 1933, Ulbricht lived in Paris and Prague from 1933 to 1937 and in the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1945.\nAfter the end of World War II, Ulbricht re-organized the German Communist Party in the Soviet occupation zone along Stalinist lines. He played a key role in the forcible merger of the KPD and SPD into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1946. He became the First Secretary of the SED and effective leader of the recently established East Germany in 1950. The Soviet Army occupation force violently suppressed the uprising of 1953 in East Germany on 17 June 1953, while Ulbricht hid in the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin-Karlshorst. East Germany joined the Soviet-controlled Warsaw Pact upon its founding in 1955. Ulbricht presided over the total suppression of civil and political rights in the East German state, which functioned as a communist-ruled dictatorship from its founding in 1949 onward.\nThe nationalization of East German industry under Ulbricht failed to raise the standard of living to a level comparable to that of West Germany. The result was massive emigration, with hundreds of thousands of people fleeing the country to the west every year in the 1950s. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave permission for a wall to stop the outflow in Berlin, Ulbricht had the Berlin Wall built in 1961, which triggered a diplomatic crisis and succeeded in curtailing emigration. The failures of Ulbricht's New Economic System and Economic System of Socialism from 1963 to 1970 led to his forcible retirement for \"health reasons\" and replacement as First Secretary in 1971 by Erich Honecker with Soviet approval.

He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \"Yellow Submarine\", \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Man\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of others.\nStarr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalisation. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship as a machinist at a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.\nIn addition to the Beatles' films, Starr has acted in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit \"It Don't Come Easy\", and number ones \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". His most successful UK single was \"Back Off Boogaloo\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two series of the children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \"Mr. Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station. Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.\nStarr's playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings. In his opinion, his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles' \"Rain\". In 1999, he was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame. In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.

Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include \"Taxman\", \"Within You Without You\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\".\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as sitar, on numerous Beatles songs, starting with \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co-founding HandMade Films in 1978.\nHarrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\".

During his presidency, he played a key role in the Nazi seizure of power in January 1933 when, under pressure from advisers, he appointed Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany.\nPaul von Hindenburg was born on 2 October 1847 to a family of minor Prussian nobility in Posen. Upon completing his education as a cadet, he enlisted in the Third Regiment of Foot Guards as a second lieutenant. He then saw combat during the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars. In 1873, he was admitted to the prestigious Kriegsakademie in Berlin where he studied for 3 years before being appointed to the Army's General Staff Corps. Later in 1885, he was promoted to the rank of major and became a member of the Great General Staff. Following a five-year teaching stint at the Kriegsakademie, Hindenburg steadily rose through the army's ranks to become a lieutenant-general by 1900. Around the time of his promotion to General of the Infantry in 1905, Count Alfred von Schlieffen recommended that he succeed him as Chief of the Great General Staff but the post ultimately went to Helmuth von Moltke in January 1906. In 1911, Hindenburg announced his retirement from the military.\nFollowing World War I's outbreak in July 1914, he was recalled to military service and quickly achieved fame on the Eastern Front as the victor of Tannenberg. Subsequently, he oversaw a crushing series of victories against the Russians that made him a national hero and the center of a massive personality cult. By 1916, Hindenburg's popularity had risen to the point that he replaced General Erich von Falkenhayn as Chief of the Great General Staff. Thereafter, he and his deputy, General Erich Ludendorff, exploited Emperor Wilhelm II's broad delegation of power to the German Army to establish a de facto military dictatorship that dominated national policy for the rest of the war. Under their leadership, Germany secured Russia's defeat in the east and achieved advances on the Western Front deeper than any seen since the conflict's outbreak. However, by the end of 1918, all improvements in Germany's fortunes were reversed after the German Army was decisively defeated in the Second Battle of the Marne and the Allies' Hundred Days Offensive. Upon his country's capitulation to the Allies in the November 1918 armistice, Hindenburg stepped down as Germany's commander-in-chief before retiring once again from military service in 1919.\nIn 1925, Hindenburg returned to public life to become the second elected President of the German Weimar Republic. While he was personally opposed to Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party, he nonetheless played a major role in the political instability that resulted in their rise to power. Upon twice dissolving the Reichstag in 1932, Hindenburg ultimately agreed to appoint Hitler as Chancellor of Germany in January 1933 when the Nazis won a plurality in the November elections. In response to the Reichstag Fire allegedly committed by Marinus van der Lubbe, he approved the Reichstag Fire Decree in February 1933 which suspended various civil liberties. Later in March, he signed the Enabling Act of 1933 which gave the Nazi regime emergency powers. After Hindenburg died the following year, Hitler combined the Presidency with his office as Chancellor before proceeding to declare himself F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler des deutschen Volkes (i.e. \"Leader and Reich Chancellor of the German People\") and transformed Germany into a totalitarian state.", "img_list": ["Q2667_0.jpg", "Q2667_1.jpg", "Q2667_2.jpg", "Q2667_3.jpg", "Q2667_4.jpg", "Q2667_5.jpg", "Q2667_6.jpg", "Q2667_7.jpg", "Q2667_8.svg", "Q2667_9.svg", "Q2667_10.jpg", "Q2667_11.gif", "Q2667_12.ogg", "Q2667_13.ogg", "Q2667_14.svg", "Q2667_15.jpg", "Q2667_16.jpg", "Q2667_17.jpg", "Q2667_18.svg", "Q2667_19.svg", "Q2667_20.svg", "Q2667_21.svg", "Q2667_22.svg", "Q2667_23.png", "Q2667_24.svg", "Q2667_25.svg", "Q2667_26.svg", "Q2667_27.svg", "Q2667_28.svg", "Q2667_29.svg", "Q2667_30.svg", "Q2667_31.svg", "Q2667_32.svg", "Q2667_33.svg", "Q2667_34.svg", "Q2667_35.svg", "Q2667_36.svg", "Q2667_37.svg", "Q2667_38.svg", "Q2667_39.svg", "Q2667_40.svg", "Q2667_41.svg", "Q2667_42.svg", "Q2667_43.svg", "Q2667_44.jpg", "Q2667_45.jpg", "Q2667_46.jpg", "Q2667_47.jpg", "Q2667_48.jpg", "Q2667_49.jpg", "Q2667_50.jpg", "Q2667_51.jpg", "Q2667_52.jpg", "Q2667_53.svg", "Q2667_54.jpg", "Q2667_55.JPG", "Q2667_56.jpg", "Q2667_57.svg", "Q2667_58.jpg", "Q2667_59.JPG", "Q2667_60.jpg", "Q2667_61.jpg", "Q2667_62.jpg", "Q2667_63.jpg", "Q2667_64.svg", "Q2667_65.svg", "Q2667_66.svg", "Q2667_67.svg"], "summary": "Paul von Hindenburg:Sex: male.

He is a black belt in Tang Soo Do, Brazilian jiu jitsu and judo. After serving in the United States Air Force, Norris won many martial arts championships and later founded his own discipline Chun Kuk Do. Shortly after, in Hollywood, Norris trained celebrities in martial arts. Norris went on to appear in a minor role in the spy film The Wrecking Crew (1969). Friend and fellow martial artist Bruce Lee invited him to play one of the main villains in Way of the Dragon (1972). While Norris continued acting, friend and student Steve McQueen suggested him to take it seriously. Norris took the starring role in the action film Breaker! Breaker! (1977), which turned a profit. His second lead Good Guys Wear Black (1978) became a hit, and he soon became a popular action film star.\nNorris went on to star in a streak of bankable independently-made action and martial arts films, with A Force of One (1979), The Octagon (1980), and An Eye for an Eye (1981). This made Norris an international celebrity. He went on to make studio films like Silent Rage (1982) with Columbia, Forced Vengeance (1982) with MGM, and Lone Wolf McQuade (1983) with Orion. This led Cannon films to sign Norris into a multiple film deal, starting with Missing in Action (1984), which proved to be very successful and launched a trilogy. Norris started to work almost exclusively on high-profile action films with Cannon, becoming their leading star during the 1980s. Films with Cannon included Invasion U.S.A (1985), The Delta Force (1986), Firewalker (1986), etc. Apart from the Cannon films, Norris made Code of Silence (1985), which was received as one of his best films. In the 1990s, he played the title role in the long running CBS television series Walker, Texas Ranger from 1993 until 2001. Until 2006, Norris continued taking lead roles in action movies, including Delta Force 2 (1990), The Hitman (1991), Sidekicks (1992), Forest Warrior (1996), The President's Man and its sequel (2002). Norris made his last film appearance to date in Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables 2 (2012).\nThroughout his film and TV career Norris diversified from his regular endeavors. He is a noted writer, having penned books on martial arts, exercise, philosophy, politics, Christianity, western novels, and biography. He was twice a New York Times bestselling author, first with his book on his personal philosophy of positive force and the psychology of self-improvement based on personal anecdotes called The Secret of Inner Strength: My Story (1988). His second New York Times Best Seller, Black Belt Patriotism: How to Reawaken America (2008), was about his critique on current issues in the USA. Norris also appeared in several commercials endorsing several products most notably being one of the main spokespersons for the Total Gym infomercials. In 2005, Norris found new fame on the Internet when Chuck Norris facts became an Internet meme documenting humorous, fictional and often absurd feats of strength and endurance. Although Norris himself did not produce the \"facts\", he was hired to endorse many products that incorporated Chuck Norris facts in advertising. The phenomenon resulted in six books (two of them New York Times best sellers), two video games, and several appearances on talk shows, such as Late Night with Conan O'Brien where he read the facts or participated in sketches.", "img_list": ["Q2673_0.jpg", "Q2673_1.jpg", "Q2673_2.svg", "Q2673_3.jpg", "Q2673_4.jpg", "Q2673_5.jpg", "Q2673_6.jpg", "Q2673_7.jpg", "Q2673_8.JPG", "Q2673_9.jpg", "Q2673_10.jpg", "Q2673_11.JPG", "Q2673_12.svg"], "summary": "Chuck Norris:Sex: male.

Despite strengthening the German Empire's position as a great power by building a powerful navy, his tactless public statements and erratic foreign policy greatly antagonized the international community and are considered by many to be one of the underlying causes for World War I. When the German war effort collapsed after a series of crushing defeats on the Western Front in 1918, he was forced to abdicate, thereby bringing an end to the House of Hohenzollern's 400-year reign.\nWilhelm II was the son of Prince Frederick William of Prussia and Victoria, Princess Royal. His father was the son of Wilhelm I, German Emperor, and his mother was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Wilhelm's grandfather, Wilhelm I, died in March 1888. His father became Emperor Frederick III, but died just 99 days later, and Wilhelm II ascended the throne in June 1888.\nIn March 1890, Wilhelm II dismissed the German Empire's powerful longtime chancellor, Otto von Bismarck and assumed direct control over his nation's policies, embarking on a bellicose \"New Course\" to cement its status as a leading world power. Over the course of his reign, the German colonial empire acquired new territories in China and the Pacific (such as Kiautschou Bay, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Caroline Islands) and became Europe's largest manufacturer. However, Wilhelm often undermined such progress by making tactless statements and threats towards other countries without first consulting his ministers. Britain became Germany's main enemy when the Kaiser launched a massive expansion of the Imperial German Navy. By 1910 Germany had two allies left: the weak Austria-Hungary and the declining Ottoman Empire.\nWilhelm's reign culminated in Germany's guarantee of military support to Austria-Hungary during the crisis of July 1914, one of the immediate causes for World War I. By this time Wilhelm had lost virtually all decision-making power. Indeed all civilian officials were losing power to the Army's General Staff. By August 1916, a de facto military dictatorship set national policy for the rest of the conflict. Despite emerging victorious over Russia and obtaining significant territorial gains in Eastern Europe, Germany was forced to relinquish all its conquests after a decisive defeat on the Western Front in the fall of 1918. Losing the support of his country's military and many of his subjects, Wilhelm was forced to abdicate during the German Revolution of 1918\u20131919. The revolution converted Germany from a monarchy into an unstable democratic state known as the Weimar Republic. Wilhelm fled to exile in the Netherlands where he remained during its occupation by Nazi Germany in 1940. He died there in 1941.", "img_list": ["Q2677_0.jpg", "Q2677_1.jpg", "Q2677_2.jpg", "Q2677_3.jpg", "Q2677_4.jpg", "Q2677_5.jpg", "Q2677_6.jpg", "Q2677_7.jpg", "Q2677_8.jpg", "Q2677_9.svg", "Q2677_10.jpg", "Q2677_11.svg", "Q2677_12.svg", "Q2677_13.svg", "Q2677_14.svg", "Q2677_15.svg", "Q2677_16.svg", "Q2677_17.svg", "Q2677_18.svg", "Q2677_19.svg", "Q2677_20.svg", "Q2677_21.svg", "Q2677_22.png", "Q2677_23.svg", "Q2677_24.svg", "Q2677_25.svg", "Q2677_26.svg", "Q2677_27.svg", "Q2677_28.svg", "Q2677_29.svg", "Q2677_30.svg", "Q2677_31.svg", "Q2677_32.svg", "Q2677_33.svg", "Q2677_34.svg", "Q2677_35.svg", "Q2677_36.svg", "Q2677_37.svg", "Q2677_38.svg", "Q2677_39.svg", "Q2677_40.svg", "Q2677_41.svg", "Q2677_42.svg", "Q2677_43.svg", "Q2677_44.svg", "Q2677_45.svg", "Q2677_46.svg", "Q2677_47.svg", "Q2677_48.svg", "Q2677_49.svg", "Q2677_50.svg", "Q2677_51.svg", "Q2677_52.svg", "Q2677_53.svg", "Q2677_54.svg", "Q2677_55.svg", "Q2677_56.svg", "Q2677_57.svg", "Q2677_58.svg", "Q2677_59.svg", "Q2677_60.svg", "Q2677_61.svg", "Q2677_62.svg", "Q2677_63.svg", "Q2677_64.jpg", "Q2677_65.jpg", "Q2677_66.jpg", "Q2677_67.gif", "Q2677_68.svg", "Q2677_69.svg", "Q2677_70.JPG", "Q2677_71.JPG", "Q2677_72.png", "Q2677_73.jpg", "Q2677_74.jpg", "Q2677_75.jpg", "Q2677_76.jpg", "Q2677_77.JPG", "Q2677_78.svg", "Q2677_79.jpg", "Q2677_80.svg", "Q2677_81.jpg", "Q2677_82.svg", "Q2677_83.svg", "Q2677_84.jpg", "Q2677_85.svg", "Q2677_86.svg", "Q2677_87.jpg", "Q2677_88.jpeg", "Q2677_89.jpg", "Q2677_90.svg", "Q2677_91.svg", "Q2677_92.svg", "Q2677_93.jpg", "Q2677_94.jpg", "Q2677_95.svg", "Q2677_96.jpeg", "Q2677_97.ogg", "Q2677_98.jpg"], "summary": "Wilhelm II, German Emperor:Sex: male.

Before his tenure as president, he previously served as President of the Supreme Audit Office from 1992 to 1995 and later Minister of Justice and Public Prosecutor General in Jerzy Buzek's cabinet from 2000 until his dismissal in July 2001.\nBorn in Warsaw, he starred in a 1962 Polish film, The Two Who Stole the Moon, with his identical twin brother Jaros\u0142aw. Kaczy\u0144ski was a graduate of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980, he was awarded his Ph.D. by Gda\u0144sk University. In 1990, he completed his habilitation in labour and employment law. He later assumed professorial positions at Gda\u0144sk University and Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski University in Warsaw.\nDuring the communist period, Kaczy\u0144ski was an activist in the pro-democratic anti-communist movement in Poland, the Workers' Defence Committee, as well as the Independent Trade Union movement. In August 1980, he became an adviser to the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee in the Gda\u0144sk Shipyard and the Solidarity movement. After the communists imposed martial law in December 1981, he was interned as an \"anti-socialist element\". After his release, he returned to trade union activities, becoming a member of the underground Solidarity. When Solidarity was legalized again in the late 1980s, Kaczy\u0144ski was an active adviser to Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa and his Solidarity Citizens' Committee in 1988.\nFrom February to April 1989, he participated in the Polish Round Table Talks along with his brother. After Solidarity's victory in the 1989 Polish legislative election, Kaczy\u0144ski became a senator and vice-chairman of the movement. Then in the 1991 Polish parliamentary election, he was elected into the Sejm as a non-party member. He was also the main adviser and supporter of Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa when the latter was elected President of Poland in December 1990. Wa\u0142\u0119sa nominated Kaczy\u0144ski to be the Security Minister in the Presidential Chancellery but fired him in 1992 due to a conflict concerning Jan Olszewski's government. In 2003, Kaczy\u0144ski co-founded the Law and Justice party, after splitting from the Solidarity Electoral Action and the Christian National Union, along with his brother.

From 1850 to 1886, Geronimo joined with members of three other Chiricahua Apache bands\u2014the Tchihende, the Tsokanende and the Nednhi\u2014to carry out numerous raids, as well as fight against Mexican and U.S. military campaigns in the northern Mexico states of Chihuahua and Sonora and in the southwestern American territories of New Mexico and Arizona. \nGeronimo's raids and related combat actions were a part of the prolonged period of the Apache\u2013United States conflict, which started with American settlement in Apache lands following the end of the war with Mexico in 1848. Reservation life was confining to the free-moving Apache people, and they resented restrictions on their customary way of life. Geronimo led breakouts from the reservations in attempts to return his people to their previous nomadic lifestyle. During Geronimo's final period of conflict from 1876 to 1886, he surrendered three times and eventually accepted life on the Apache reservations. While well-known, Geronimo was not a chief of the Chiricahua or the Bedonkohe band. However, since he was a superb leader in raiding and warfare, he frequently led large numbers of men beyond his own following. At any one time, he would be in command of about 30 to 50 Apaches.In 1886, after an intense pursuit in northern Mexico by American forces that followed Geronimo's third 1885 reservation breakout, Geronimo surrendered for the last time to Lt. Charles Bare Gatewood. Geronimo and 27 other Apaches were later sent to join the rest of the Chiricahua tribe, which had been previously exiled to Florida. While holding him as a prisoner, the United States capitalized on Geronimo\u2019s fame among non-Indians by displaying him at various fairs and exhibitions, which provided Geronimo in turn with the opportunity to make some money by selling merchandise. In 1898, for example, Geronimo was exhibited at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exhibition in Omaha, Nebraska; seven years later, the Indian Office provided Geronimo for the inaugural parade for President Theodore Roosevelt. He died at the Fort Sill hospital in 1909, as a prisoner of war, and was buried at the Fort Sill Indian Agency Cemetery, among the graves of relatives and other Apache prisoners of war.", "img_list": ["Q2791_0.svg", "Q2791_1.jpg", "Q2791_2.jpg", "Q2791_3.jpg", "Q2791_4.jpg", "Q2791_5.jpg", "Q2791_6.jpg", "Q2791_7.jpg", "Q2791_8.jpg", "Q2791_9.jpg", "Q2791_10.jpg", "Q2791_11.svg", "Q2791_12.jpg", "Q2791_13.svg", "Q2791_14.jpg", "Q2791_15.svg", "Q2791_16.svg", "Q2791_17.jpg"], "summary": "Geronimo:Sex: male.

He met his longtime musical partner Taupin in 1967, after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for other artists, and John worked as a session musician for artists including the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969, John's debut album, Empty Sky, was released. In 1970, his first hit single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, Elton John, became his first top ten in both the UK and the US. Since 1970, he has toured with the Elton John Band as the pianist and lead singer.

Before his political career, Lukashenko worked as director of a state farm (sovkhoz), and served in the Soviet Border Troops and in the Soviet Army.\nLukashenko continued state ownership of key industries in Belarus after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and retained important Soviet-era symbolism, which can be seen in the coat of arms and national flag of Belarus, adopted following a controversial 1995 referendum, which were based on the symbols of the Byelorussian SSR. Following the same referendum, Lukashenko was given more power with the ability to dismiss the Supreme Soviet of Belarus and another referendum in 1996 allowed Lukashenko to further consolidate power. The Russian language was also given the same status as Belarusian, and economic ties with Russia were strengthened, which furthermore led to the creation of the Union State with Russia, which allows Belarusians to freely travel to, work, and study in Russia, and vice versa. However, relations with Russia have not always run smoothly under his tenure, such as during the Milk Wars.Lukashenko heads an authoritarian government and has proudly referred to himself as \"Europe's last dictator\". Elections are not considered to be free and fair by international monitors, opponents of the regime are repressed, and the media is not free, leading to sanctions on Lukashenko and other Belarusian officials being imposed. His disputed victory in the country's 2020 presidential election led to widespread allegations of vote rigging, which strongly amplified anti-government protests, the largest during his rule. Protesters have faced violent persecution by the authorities. A statement by the United Nations Human Rights Office on 1 September 2020 cited more than 450 documented cases of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, as well as reports of sexual abuse and rape. Following the contested election, Lukashenko is not recognized by the United Kingdom, the European Union, or the United States as the legitimate president of Belarus, although he remains recognized by a number of states including Russia, China, Iran, Armenia, Syria, Venezuela, and Cuba.", "img_list": ["Q2866_0.jpg", "Q2866_1.svg", "Q2866_2.svg", "Q2866_3.svg", "Q2866_4.svg", "Q2866_5.svg", "Q2866_6.svg", "Q2866_7.svg", "Q2866_8.svg", "Q2866_9.svg", "Q2866_10.svg", "Q2866_11.svg", "Q2866_12.svg", "Q2866_13.svg", "Q2866_14.svg", "Q2866_15.svg", "Q2866_16.svg", "Q2866_17.svg", "Q2866_18.svg", "Q2866_19.svg", "Q2866_20.svg", "Q2866_21.svg", "Q2866_22.svg", "Q2866_23.svg", "Q2866_24.svg", "Q2866_25.svg", "Q2866_26.svg", "Q2866_27.svg", "Q2866_28.svg", "Q2866_29.svg", "Q2866_30.svg", "Q2866_31.svg", "Q2866_32.svg", "Q2866_33.svg", "Q2866_34.svg", "Q2866_35.svg", "Q2866_36.svg", "Q2866_37.svg", "Q2866_38.svg", "Q2866_39.svg", "Q2866_40.svg", "Q2866_41.svg", "Q2866_42.svg", "Q2866_43.svg", "Q2866_44.svg", "Q2866_45.svg", "Q2866_46.svg", "Q2866_47.svg", "Q2866_48.svg", "Q2866_49.svg", "Q2866_50.svg", "Q2866_51.svg", "Q2866_52.svg", "Q2866_53.svg", "Q2866_54.svg", "Q2866_55.svg", "Q2866_56.svg", "Q2866_57.svg", "Q2866_58.svg", "Q2866_59.svg", "Q2866_60.svg", "Q2866_61.svg", "Q2866_62.svg", "Q2866_63.svg", "Q2866_64.svg", "Q2866_65.svg", "Q2866_66.svg", "Q2866_67.svg", "Q2866_68.svg", "Q2866_69.svg", "Q2866_70.svg", "Q2866_71.svg", "Q2866_72.svg", "Q2866_73.svg", "Q2866_74.svg", "Q2866_75.svg", "Q2866_76.svg", "Q2866_77.svg", "Q2866_78.svg", "Q2866_79.svg", "Q2866_80.svg", "Q2866_81.svg", "Q2866_82.svg", "Q2866_83.svg", "Q2866_84.svg", "Q2866_85.svg", "Q2866_86.svg", "Q2866_87.svg", "Q2866_88.svg", "Q2866_89.svg", "Q2866_90.svg", "Q2866_91.svg", "Q2866_92.svg", "Q2866_93.svg", "Q2866_94.svg", "Q2866_95.svg", "Q2866_96.svg", "Q2866_97.svg", "Q2866_98.svg", "Q2866_99.svg", "Q2866_100.svg", "Q2866_101.svg", "Q2866_102.svg", "Q2866_103.svg", "Q2866_104.svg", "Q2866_105.svg", "Q2866_106.svg", "Q2866_107.svg", "Q2866_108.svg", "Q2866_109.svg", "Q2866_110.svg", "Q2866_111.svg", "Q2866_112.svg", "Q2866_113.svg", "Q2866_114.svg", "Q2866_115.svg", "Q2866_116.svg", "Q2866_117.svg", "Q2866_118.svg", "Q2866_119.svg", "Q2866_120.svg", "Q2866_121.svg", "Q2866_122.svg", "Q2866_123.svg", "Q2866_124.svg", "Q2866_125.svg", "Q2866_126.svg", "Q2866_127.svg", "Q2866_128.svg", "Q2866_129.svg", "Q2866_130.svg", "Q2866_131.svg", "Q2866_132.svg", "Q2866_133.svg", "Q2866_134.svg", "Q2866_135.svg", "Q2866_136.svg", "Q2866_137.svg", "Q2866_138.svg", "Q2866_139.svg", "Q2866_140.svg", "Q2866_141.svg", "Q2866_142.svg", "Q2866_143.svg", "Q2866_144.svg", "Q2866_145.svg", "Q2866_146.svg", "Q2866_147.svg", "Q2866_148.svg", "Q2866_149.svg", "Q2866_150.jpg", "Q2866_151.jpg", "Q2866_152.jpg", "Q2866_153.jpg", "Q2866_154.jpg", "Q2866_155.jpg", "Q2866_156.jpg", "Q2866_157.jpg", "Q2866_158.svg", "Q2866_159.jpg", "Q2866_160.jpg", "Q2866_161.jpg", "Q2866_162.jpg", "Q2866_163.svg", "Q2866_164.jpg", "Q2866_165.jpg", "Q2866_169.svg", "Q2866_171.svg", "Q2866_177.svg", "Q2866_178.svg", "Q2866_179.svg", "Q2866_180.svg", "Q2866_181.svg", "Q2866_182.svg"], "summary": "Alexander Lukashenko:Sex: male.

Dubbed the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.\nPresley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA Victor single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll.\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.\nHaving sold over 500 million records worldwide, Presley is recognized as the best-selling solo music artist of all time by Guinness World Records. He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, R&B, adult contemporary, and gospel. Presley won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Donald Trump.", "img_list": ["Q303_0.jpg", "Q303_1.jpg", "Q303_2.jpg", "Q303_3.jpg", "Q303_4.jpg", "Q303_5.jpg", "Q303_6.jpg", "Q303_7.jpg", "Q303_8.jpg", "Q303_9.jpg", "Q303_10.jpg", "Q303_11.jpg", "Q303_12.jpg", "Q303_13.jpg", "Q303_14.jpg", "Q303_15.jpg", "Q303_16.jpg", "Q303_17.svg", "Q303_18.svg", "Q303_19.jpg", "Q303_20.jpg", "Q303_21.jpg", "Q303_22.jpg", "Q303_23.svg", "Q303_26.jpg"], "summary": "Elvis Presley:Sex: male.

During the Early Middle Ages, Charlemagne united the majority of western and central Europe. He was the first recognized emperor to rule from western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire around three centuries earlier. The expanded Frankish state that Charlemagne founded is known as the Carolingian Empire. He was later canonised by Antipope Paschal III, and is regarded as beatified, which is a step on the path to sainthood, by the mainstream Catholic Church.\nCharlemagne was the eldest son of Pepin the Short and Bertrada of Laon, born before their canonical marriage. He became king of the Franks in 768 following his father's death, initially as co-ruler with his brother Carloman I, until the latter's death in 771. As sole ruler, he continued his father's policy towards the papacy and became its protector, removing the Lombards from power in northern Italy and leading an incursion into Muslim Spain. He campaigned against the Saxons to his east, Christianising them upon penalty of death and leading to events such as the Massacre of Verden. He reached the height of his power in 800 when he was crowned \"Emperor of the Romans\" by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day at Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\nCharlemagne has been called the \"Father of Europe\" (Pater Europae), as he united most of Western Europe for the first time since the classical era of the Roman Empire and united parts of Europe that had never been under Frankish or Roman rule. His rule spurred the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of energetic cultural and intellectual activity within the Western Church. The Eastern Orthodox Church viewed Charlemagne less favourably due to his support of the filioque and the Pope's having preferred him as emperor over the Byzantine Empire's first female monarch, Irene of Athens. These and other disputes led to the eventual later split of Rome and Constantinople in the Great Schism of 1054.Charlemagne died in 814. He was laid to rest in the Aachen Cathedral, in his imperial capital city of Aachen. Charlemagne married at least four times, and had three legitimate sons who lived to adulthood. Only the youngest of them, Louis the Pious, survived to succeed him. He also had numerous illegitimate children with his concubines.", "img_list": ["Q3044_0.jpg", "Q3044_1.jpg", "Q3044_2.jpg", "Q3044_3.jpg", "Q3044_4.jpg", "Q3044_5.jpg", "Q3044_6.svg", "Q3044_7.jpg", "Q3044_8.jpg", "Q3044_9.jpg", "Q3044_10.jpg", "Q3044_11.jpg", "Q3044_12.svg", "Q3044_13.jpg", "Q3044_14.jpg", "Q3044_15.jpg", "Q3044_16.jpg", "Q3044_17.jpg", "Q3044_18.jpg", "Q3044_19.jpg", "Q3044_20.svg", "Q3044_21.jpg", "Q3044_22.svg", "Q3044_23.jpg", "Q3044_24.jpg", "Q3044_25.jpg", "Q3044_26.gif", "Q3044_27.png", "Q3044_28.svg", "Q3044_29.png", "Q3044_30.svg", "Q3044_31.jpg", "Q3044_32.jpg", "Q3044_33.jpg", "Q3044_34.jpg", "Q3044_35.jpg", "Q3044_36.jpg", "Q3044_37.svg", "Q3044_38.jpg", "Q3044_39.jpg", "Q3044_40.svg", "Q3044_41.JPG", "Q3044_42.jpg", "Q3044_43.svg", "Q3044_44.JPG", "Q3044_45.svg", "Q3044_46.svg", "Q3044_47.svg", "Q3044_48.svg", "Q3044_49.svg", "Q3044_54.jpg"], "summary": "Charlemagne:Sex: male.

Mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine from 1983 to 2002, he was Minister of the Budget under Prime Minister \u00c9douard Balladur (1993\u20131995) during Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term.

He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor in 1933 and then assuming the title of F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler in 1934. During his dictatorship, he initiated World War II in Europe by invading Poland on 1 September 1939. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was central to the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.\nHitler was born in Austria-Hungary, and was raised near Linz. He lived in Vienna later in the first decade of the 1900s and moved to Germany in 1913. He was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party (DAP), the precursor of the Nazi Party, and was appointed leader of the Nazi Party in 1921. In 1923, he attempted to seize governmental power in a failed coup in Munich and was imprisoned with a sentence of five years. In jail, he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf (\"My Struggle\"). After his early release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as part of a Jewish conspiracy.\nBy November 1932, the Nazi Party held the most seats in the German Reichstag, but did not have a majority. As a result, no party was able to form a majority parliamentary coalition in support of a candidate for chancellor. Former chancellor Franz von Papen and other conservative leaders persuaded President Paul von Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as chancellor on 30 January 1933. Shortly after, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act of 1933 which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the abrogation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories inhabited by millions of ethnic Germans, which gave him significant popular support.\nHitler sought Lebensraum (lit.\u2009'living space') for the German people in Eastern Europe, and his aggressive foreign policy is considered the primary cause of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and, on 1 September 1939, invaded Poland, resulting in Britain and France declaring war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. These gains were gradually reversed after 1941, and in 1945 the Allied armies defeated the German army. On 29 April 1945, he married his longtime lover Eva Braun in the F\u00fchrerbunker in Berlin. Less than two days later, the couple committed suicide to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army. Their corpses were burned.\nHistorian and biographer Ian Kershaw describes Hitler as \"the embodiment of modern political evil\". Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (subhumans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 28.7 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European theatre.

WikiLeaks came to international attention in 2010 when it published a series of leaks provided by U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning (formerly Bradley Manning). These leaks included the Baghdad airstrike Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and Cablegate (November 2010). After the 2010 leaks, the United States government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks.In November 2010, Sweden issued an international arrest warrant for Assange over allegations of sexual misconduct. Assange said the allegations were a pretext for his extradition from Sweden to the United States over his role in the publication of secret American documents. After losing his battle against extradition to Sweden, he breached bail and took refuge in the Embassy of Ecuador in London in June 2012. He was granted asylum by Ecuador in August 2012 on the grounds of political persecution, with the presumption that if he were extradited to Sweden, he would be eventually extradited to the US. Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation in 2019, saying their evidence had \"weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question.\"During the 2016 U.S. election campaign, WikiLeaks published confidential Democratic Party emails, showing that the party's national committee favoured Hillary Clinton over her rival Bernie Sanders in the primaries.On 11 April 2019, Assange's asylum was withdrawn following a series of disputes with the Ecuadorian authorities. The police were invited into the embassy and he was arrested. He was found guilty of breaching the Bail Act and sentenced to 50 weeks in prison. The United States government unsealed an indictment against Assange related to the leaks provided by Manning. On 23 May 2019, the United States government further charged Assange with violating the Espionage Act of 1917. Editors from newspapers, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, as well as press freedom organisations, criticised the government's decision to charge Assange under the Espionage Act, characterising it as an attack on the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guarantees freedom of the press. On 4 January 2021, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled against the United States' request to extradite him and stated that doing so would be \"oppressive\" given concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide. On 6 January 2021, Assange was denied bail, pending an appeal by the United States. On 10 December 2021, Britain's High Court ruled that Assange can be extradited to the US to face the charges.Assange has been confined in Belmarsh maximum-security prison in London since April 2019.", "img_list": ["Q360_0.jpg", "Q360_1.jpg", "Q360_2.ogv", "Q360_3.jpg", "Q360_4.svg", "Q360_5.jpg", "Q360_6.jpg", "Q360_7.svg", "Q360_8.jpg", "Q360_9.jpg", "Q360_10.jpg", "Q360_11.jpg", "Q360_12.jpg", "Q360_13.jpg", "Q360_14.jpg", "Q360_15.jpg", "Q360_16.jpg", "Q360_17.jpg", "Q360_18.svg", "Q360_19.JPG", "Q360_20.jpg", "Q360_21.svg", "Q360_22.svg", "Q360_23.jpg"], "summary": "Julian Assange:Sex: male.

His films are characterized by nonlinear storylines, dark humor, stylized violence, foot fetishism, extended dialogue, ensemble casts, references to popular culture, alternate history, and neo-noir.\nBorn in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tarantino grew up in Los Angeles. He began his career as an independent filmmaker with the release of Reservoir Dogs in 1992, a crime thriller in part funded by the sale of his screenplay True Romance (1993); Empire hailed Reservoir Dogs as the \"Greatest Independent Film of All Time\". His second film, Pulp Fiction (1994), a crime comedy, was a major success among critics and audiences and won numerous awards, including the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He wrote the screenplay for From Dusk till Dawn (1996), in which he also starred, while Tarantino's third film, Jackie Brown (1997), paid homage to blaxploitation films.\nIn 2003, Tarantino delivered Kill Bill: Volume 1, stylized in cinematic traditions of kung fu films and Japanese martial arts, the animation sequences in the film were inspired from Aalavandan; Volume 2 followed in 2004. Tarantino then directed the exploitation slasher Death Proof (2007), part of a double feature with Robert Rodriguez released in the custom of 1970s grindhouse, under the collective title Grindhouse. His long-postponed Inglourious Basterds (2009) told an alternate history and explored subgenres of war films; it was followed by Django Unchained (2012), a Spaghetti Western, which won him his second Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Tarantino's eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a long-form revisionist Western thriller with a roadshow release, while his most recent film, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), was a comedy-drama which explored Old Hollywood. He published his debut novel, a novelization of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, in 2021.\nTarantino's films have garnered critical and commercial success, as well as a cult following. He has received many industry awards, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and the Palme d'Or, and has been nominated for an Emmy and five Grammys. In 2005, he was included on the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world. Filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him \"the single most influential director of his generation\"; Tarantino has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry.Tarantino's works have been subject to controversy, including his depictions of violence and frequent inclusion of racial slurs, and alleged negligence in his handling of stunt scenes in Kill Bill: Volume 2.", "img_list": ["Q3772_0.svg", "Q3772_1.jpg", "Q3772_2.svg", "Q3772_3.jpg", "Q3772_4.jpg", "Q3772_5.jpg", "Q3772_6.jpg", "Q3772_7.jpg", "Q3772_8.svg", "Q3772_13.jpg"], "summary": "Quentin Tarantino:Sex: male.

After graduating from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1949, Kelly began appearing in New York City theatrical productions and over 40 live drama productions broadcast in early 1950s Golden Age of Television. She gained stardom from her performance in John Ford's adventure-romance Mogambo (1953), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the drama The Country Girl (1954). Other notable works include the western High Noon (1952), the romantic comedy High Society (1956), and three consecutive Alfred Hitchcock suspense thrillers: Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954), and To Catch a Thief (1955). Kelly worked with some of the most prominent leading men of the era, including Gary Cooper, Clark Gable, Ray Milland, James Stewart, Bing Crosby, William Holden, Cary Grant, Alec Guinness, and Frank Sinatra.\nKelly retired from acting at age 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. Hitchcock hoped that she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement. The Prince and Princess had three children: Princess Caroline, Prince Albert, and Princess St\u00e9phanie. Princess Grace retained her link to America by her dual U.S. and Mon\u00e9gasque citizenship. Her charity work focused on young children and the arts, establishing the Princess Grace Foundation to support local artisans in 1964. Her organization for children's rights, AMADE Mondiale, gained consultive status within UNICEF and UNESCO. Her final film contribution was in 1977 to the documentary The Children of Theatre Street directed by Robert Dornhelm, where she served as the narrator. The documentary was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.\nKelly died at the age of 52 at Monaco Hospital on September 14, 1982, from injuries sustained in a car crash the previous day.  She is listed 13th among the American Film Institute's 25 Greatest Female Stars of Classical Hollywood Cinema. Her son, Prince Albert, helped establish the Princess Grace Awards in 1984 to recognize emerging performers in film, theatre, and dance.\n\n", "img_list": ["Q3925_0.svg", "Q3925_1.svg", "Q3925_2.svg", "Q3925_3.svg", "Q3925_4.svg", "Q3925_5.svg", "Q3925_6.svg", "Q3925_7.svg", "Q3925_8.jpg", "Q3925_9.jpg", "Q3925_10.jpg", "Q3925_11.jpg", "Q3925_12.jpg", "Q3925_13.svg", "Q3925_14.jpg", "Q3925_15.JPG", "Q3925_16.jpg", "Q3925_17.jpg", "Q3925_18.jpg", "Q3925_19.jpg", "Q3925_20.jpg", "Q3925_21.svg", "Q3925_22.svg", "Q3925_23.svg", "Q3925_24.svg", "Q3925_25.svg", "Q3925_26.jpg", "Q3925_27.JPG", "Q3925_28.jpg", "Q3925_29.svg", "Q3925_30.JPG", "Q3925_35.jpg"], "summary": "Grace Kelly:Sex: female.

Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning 60 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (1963) and \"The Times They Are a-Changin'\" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which mainly comprised traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan the following year. The album features \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and the thematically complex \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\". Many of his songs adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged The Times They Are a-Changin' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective Another Side of Bob Dylan in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: Bringing It All Back Home (1965), Highway 61 Revisited (1965) and Blonde on Blonde (1966). His six-minute single \"Like a Rolling Stone\" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.In July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album The Basement Tapes in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in John Wesley Harding (1967), Nashville Skyline (1969), and New Morning (1970). In 1975, he released Blood on the Tracks, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's 1997 album Time Out of Mind marked the beginning of a renaissance for his career. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since then, the most recent being Rough and Rowdy Ways (2020). He also recorded a series of three albums in the 2010s comprising versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra. Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending Tour.Since 1994, Dylan has published eight books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 125 million records, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for \"his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power\". In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\".", "img_list": ["Q392_0.jpg", "Q392_1.jpg", "Q392_2.jpg", "Q392_3.jpg", "Q392_4.jpg", "Q392_5.jpg", "Q392_6.jpg", "Q392_7.jpg", "Q392_8.jpg", "Q392_9.jpg", "Q392_10.jpg", "Q392_11.jpg", "Q392_12.svg", "Q392_13.ogg", "Q392_14.jpg", "Q392_15.jpg", "Q392_16.jpg", "Q392_17.jpg", "Q392_18.svg", "Q392_19.jpg", "Q392_20.svg", "Q392_22.svg", "Q392_23.svg", "Q392_24.svg", "Q392_25.svg", "Q392_26.jpg", "Q392_32.jpg"], "summary": "Bob Dylan:Sex: male.

He is one of the most acclaimed songwriters in popular music.\nSimon was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in the borough of Queens in New York City. He began performing with his schoolfriend Art Garfunkel in 1956 when they were still in their early teens. After limited success, the pair reunited after an electrified version of their song \"The Sound of Silence\" became a hit in 1966. Simon & Garfunkel recorded five albums together featuring songs mostly written by Simon, including the hits \"Mrs. Robinson\", \"America\", \"Bridge over Troubled Water\", and \"The Boxer\".After Simon & Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon recorded three acclaimed albums over the following five years, all of which charted in the top 5 on the Billboard 200. His 1972 self-titled album contained the hit songs \"Mother and Child Reunion\" and \"Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard\". The 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years, which featured guest vocals from Garfunkel, was his first number-one solo album, and featured the number 1 hit single \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\", among other top-40 songs such as \"Still Crazy After All These Years\", \"Gone at Last\", and \"My Little Town\".\nSimon reunited with Garfunkel for a performance in New York Central Park in 1981, drawing half a million spectators, followed by a world tour with Garfunkel. After a career slump, Simon released Graceland, an album inspired by South African township music, which sold 14 million copies worldwide and remains his most popular and acclaimed solo work.  A number of hit singles were released from the album, including \"You Can Call Me Al\", \"The Boy in the Bubble\", and \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\". It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1987.\nSimon continued to tour throughout the 1990s, wrote a Broadway musical, The Capeman, and recorded a companion album, Songs from The Capeman which was released in 1997. His 2000 album You're the One was nominated again for Album of the Year honors. He followed that album up with several years of touring, including another reunion tour with Garfunkel, and released Surprise, his last album of the decade, in 2006. In 2016 he released Stranger to Stranger, which debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Album Chart and number 1 the UK Albums Chart, and marked his greatest commercial and critical success in thirty years. His most recent album is 2018's In the Blue Light, which contains re-arrangements of lesser-known songs from his prior albums.\nSimon has earned sixteen Grammy Awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (Bridge Over Troubled Water, Still Crazy After All These Years, and Graceland), and a Lifetime Achievement Award.

His work focused on themes of American socialism and anti-fascism. His music includes songs such as \"This Land Is Your Land\", written in response to the American exceptionalist song \"God Bless America\", and has inspired several generations both politically and musically.Guthrie wrote hundreds of country, folk, and children's songs, along with ballads and improvised works. Dust Bowl Ballads, Guthrie's album of songs about the Dust Bowl period, was included on Mojo magazine's list of 100 Records That Changed The World, and many of his recorded songs are archived in the Library of Congress. Songwriters who have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence on their work include Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Johnny Cash, Bruce Springsteen, Robert Hunter, Harry Chapin, John Mellencamp, Pete Seeger, Andy Irvine, Joe Strummer, Billy Bragg, Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, Jeff Tweedy, Tom Paxton, Brian Fallon, and Sixto Rodr\u00edguez . He frequently performed with the message \"This machine kills fascists\" displayed on his guitar.\nGuthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in Okemah, Oklahoma, until he was 14, when his mother Nora was hospitalized as a consequence of Huntington's disease, a fatal hereditary neurological disorder. His father moved to Pampa, Texas, to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. During his early teens, Guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents' friends. He married at 19, but with the advent of the dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of Okies who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station KFVD, achieving some fame from playing hillbilly music, made friends with Will Geer and John Steinbeck, and wrote a column for the communist newspaper People's World from May 1939 to January 1940.\nThroughout his life, Guthrie was associated with United States communist groups, although he did not appear to belong to any. With the outbreak of World War II and the non-aggression pact the Soviet Union had signed with Germany in 1939, the anti-Stalin owners of KFVD radio were not comfortable with Guthrie's political leanings after he wrote a song praising the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact and the Soviet partition of Poland. He left the station, ending up in New York where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album Dust Bowl Ballads, based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the \"Dust Bowl Troubadour\". In February 1940 he wrote his most famous song, \"This Land Is Your Land\".

He was the first Marxist to be elected president in a liberal democracy in Latin America.Allende's involvement in Chilean politics spanned a period of nearly forty years, having covered the posts of senator, deputy and cabinet minister. As a life-long committed member of the Socialist Party of Chile, whose foundation he had actively contributed to, he unsuccessfully ran for the national presidency in the 1952, 1958, and 1964 elections. In 1970, he won the presidency as the candidate of the Popular Unity coalition, in a close three-way race. He was elected in a run-off by Congress, as no candidate had gained a majority.\nAs president, Allende sought to nationalize major industries, expand education and improve the living standards of the working class. He clashed with the right-wing parties that controlled Congress and with the judiciary. On 11 September 1973, the military moved to oust Allende in a coup d'\u00e9tat supported by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). As troops surrounded La Moneda Palace, he gave his last speech vowing not to resign. Later that day, Allende committed suicide.Following Allende's death, General Augusto Pinochet refused to return authority to a civilian government, and Chile was later ruled by a military junta until 1990, ending more than four decades of uninterrupted democratic governance. The military junta that took over dissolved the Congress of Chile, suspended the Constitution, and began a program of persecuting alleged dissidents, in which at least 3,095 civilians disappeared or were killed.", "img_list": ["Q440_0.jpg", "Q440_1.jpg", "Q440_2.jpg", "Q440_3.jpg", "Q440_4.png", "Q440_5.jpg", "Q440_6.svg", "Q440_7.jpg", "Q440_8.tif", "Q440_9.jpg", "Q440_10.jpg", "Q440_11.jpg", "Q440_12.svg", "Q440_13.jpg", "Q440_14.svg", "Q440_15.svg"], "summary": "Salvador Allende:Sex: male.

After winning the 1990 election, Wa\u0142\u0119sa became the first democratically elected President of Poland since 1926 and the first-ever Polish President elected in popular vote. A shipyard electrician by trade, Wa\u0142\u0119sa became the leader of the Solidarity movement, and led a successful pro-democratic effort which in 1989 ended the Communist rule in Poland and ushered in the end of the Cold War.While working at the Lenin Shipyard (now Gda\u0144sk Shipyard), Wa\u0142\u0119sa, an electrician, became a trade-union activist, for which he was persecuted by the Communist authorities, placed under surveillance, fired in 1976, and arrested several times. In August 1980, he was instrumental in political negotiations that led to the ground-breaking Gda\u0144sk Agreement between striking workers and the government. He co-founded the Solidarity trade-union whose membership rose to over ten million people.After martial law in Poland was imposed and Solidarity was outlawed, Wa\u0142\u0119sa was again arrested. Released from custody, he continued his activism and was prominent in the establishment of the Round Table Agreement that led to the semi-free 1989 Polish legislative election and a Solidarity-led government. He presided over Poland's successful transition from Communism into a free-market liberal democracy, but his active role in Polish politics diminished after he narrowly lost the 1995 Polish presidential election. In 1995, he established the Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa Institute.Since 1980, Wa\u0142\u0119sa has received hundreds of prizes, honors and awards from many countries of the world. He was named the Time Person of the Year (1981) and one of Time's 100 most important people of the 20th century (1999). He has received over forty honorary degrees, including from Harvard University and Columbia University, as well as dozens of the highest state orders, including: the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Knight Grand Cross of the British Order of the Bath, and the French Grand Cross of Legion of Honour. In 1989, Wa\u0142\u0119sa was the first foreign non-head of state to address the Joint Meeting of the U.S. Congress.

In 1984, he co-founded and led the spin-off company Bain Capital, a private equity investment firm that became one of the largest of its kind in the nation.\nAfter stepping down from Bain Capital and his local leadership role in the LDS Church, Romney was the Republican nominee in the 1994 United States Senate election in Massachusetts. After losing to five-term incumbent Ted Kennedy, he resumed his position at Bain Capital. Years later, a successful stint as president and CEO of the then-struggling Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Winter Olympics led to a relaunch of his political career. Elected governor of Massachusetts in 2002, Romney helped develop and later signed a health care reform law (commonly called \"Romneycare\") that provided near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and individual mandates to purchase insurance. He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2\u20131.5 billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and closing corporate tax loopholes. He did not seek reelection in 2006, focusing instead on his campaign for the Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Though he won several primaries and caucuses, Romney ultimately lost the nomination to Senator John McCain. Romney's considerable net worth, estimated in 2012 at $190\u2013250 million, helped finance his political campaigns before 2012, when he again ran for and won the Republican presidential nomination, becoming the first Mormon to be a major party's nominee. He lost the election to incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama, losing the Electoral College by a margin of 206\u2013332 and the popular vote by 47%\u201351%, almost five million votes.\nAfter reestablishing residency in Utah, Romney announced his campaign for the U.S. Senate seat held by the retiring Orrin Hatch in the 2018 election; he defeated state representative Mike Kennedy in the Republican primary and Democratic nominee Jenny Wilson in the general election. In doing so, he became only the third person ever to be elected governor of one state and U.S. senator for another state (the others are Sam Houston and William Bibb). Romney was sworn in on January 3, 2019. In February 2020, Romney was the only Republican senator to vote to convict President Donald Trump in his first impeachment trial, and in February 2021, he joined six other Republicans in voting to convict in Trump's second impeachment trial.", "img_list": ["Q4496_0.svg", "Q4496_1.png", "Q4496_2.jpg", "Q4496_3.jpg", "Q4496_4.svg", "Q4496_6.jpg", "Q4496_7.jpg", "Q4496_8.svg", "Q4496_9.jpg", "Q4496_10.jpg", "Q4496_11.jpg", "Q4496_12.jpg", "Q4496_13.jpg", "Q4496_14.jpg", "Q4496_15.jpg", "Q4496_16.jpg", "Q4496_17.jpg", "Q4496_18.jpg", "Q4496_19.svg", "Q4496_20.jpg", "Q4496_21.jpg", "Q4496_22.jpg", "Q4496_23.jpg", "Q4496_24.jpg", "Q4496_25.PNG", "Q4496_26.jpg", "Q4496_27.jpg", "Q4496_28.JPG", "Q4496_29.jpg", "Q4496_30.svg", "Q4496_31.svg", "Q4496_32.tif", "Q4496_33.jpg", "Q4496_34.jpg", "Q4496_35.jpg", "Q4496_36.svg", "Q4496_37.svg", "Q4496_38.svg", "Q4496_39.svg", "Q4496_40.svg"], "summary": "Mitt Romney:Sex: male.

The following year he won his brother's Parliamentary seat of Amethi and became a member of the Lok Sabha\u2014the lower house of India's Parliament. As part of his political grooming, Rajiv was made general secretary of the Congress party and given significant responsibility in organising the 1982 Asian Games.\nOn the morning of 31 October 1984, his mother was assassinated by one of her bodyguards; later that day, Gandhi was appointed prime minister. His leadership was tested over the next few days as organised mobs of Congress supporters rioted against the Sikh community, resulting in anti-Sikh massacres in Delhi. Sources estimate the number of Sikh deaths at about 8,000\u201317,000. That December, Congress party won the largest Lok Sabha majority to date, 411 seats out of 542. Rajiv Gandhi's period in office was mired in controversies; perhaps the greatest crises were the Bhopal disaster, Bofors scandal and Mohd. Ahmed Khan v. Shah Bano Begum. In 1988, he reversed the coup in Maldives, antagonising militant Tamil groups such as PLOTE, intervening and then sending peacekeeping troops to Sri Lanka in 1987, leading to open conflict with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). In mid-1987, the Bofors scandal damaged his corruption-free image and resulted in a major defeat for his party in the 1989 election.\nGandhi remained Congress President until the elections in 1991. While campaigning for the elections, he was assassinated by a suicide bomber from the LTTE. His widow Sonia became the president of the Congress party in 1998 and led the party to victory in the 2004 and 2009 parliamentary elections. His son Rahul Gandhi is a Member of Parliament and was the President of the Indian National Congress till 2019. In 1991, the Indian government posthumously awarded Gandhi the Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian award. At the India Leadership Conclave in 2009, the Revolutionary Leader of Modern India award was conferred posthumously on Gandhi.", "img_list": ["Q4593_0.jpg", "Q4593_1.svg", "Q4593_2.ogg", "Q4593_3.jpg", "Q4593_4.svg", "Q4593_5.jpg", "Q4593_6.jpg", "Q4593_7.jpg", "Q4593_8.jpg", "Q4593_9.jpg", "Q4593_10.jpg", "Q4593_11.jpg", "Q4593_12.jpg", "Q4593_13.svg", "Q4593_14.jpg"], "summary": "Rajiv Gandhi:Sex: male.

Famous for playing comedic \"blonde bombshell\" characters, she became one of the most popular sex symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s and was emblematic of the era's sexual revolution. She was a top-billed actress for a decade, and her films grossed $200 million (equivalent to $2 billion in 2020) by the time of her death in 1962. Long after her death, Monroe remains a major icon of pop culture.  In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked her sixth on their list of the greatest female screen legends from the Golden Age of Hollywood.\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, Monroe spent most of her childhood in foster homes and an orphanage; she married at age sixteen. She was working in a factory during World War II when she met a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career, which led to short-lived film contracts with 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures. After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in late 1950. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. She faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photographs prior to becoming a star, but the story did not damage her career and instead resulted in increased interest in her films.\nBy 1953, Monroe was one of the most marketable Hollywood stars; she had leading roles in the film noir Niagara, which overtly relied on her sex appeal, and the comedies Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and How to Marry a Millionaire, which established her star image as a \"dumb blonde\". The same year, her nude images were used as the centerfold and on the cover of the first issue of Playboy. She played a significant role in the creation and management of her public image throughout her career, but she was disappointed when she was typecast and underpaid by the studio. She was briefly suspended in early 1954 for refusing a film project but returned to star in The Seven Year Itch (1955), one of the biggest box office successes of her career.\nWhen the studio was still reluctant to change Monroe's contract, she founded her own film production company in 1954. She dedicated 1955 to building the company and began studying method acting under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Later that year, Fox awarded her a new contract, which gave her more control and a larger salary. Her subsequent roles included a critically acclaimed performance in Bus Stop (1956) and her first independent production in The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). She won a Golden Globe for Best Actress for her role in Some Like It Hot (1959), a critical and commercial success. Her last completed film was the drama The Misfits (1961).\nMonroe's troubled private life received much attention. She struggled with addiction and mood disorders. Her marriages to retired baseball star Joe DiMaggio and to playwright Arthur Miller were highly publicized, and both ended in divorce. On August 4, 1962, she died at age 36 from an overdose of barbiturates at her Los Angeles home. Her death was ruled a probable suicide.", "img_list": ["Q4616_0.jpg", "Q4616_1.tif", "Q4616_2.jpg", "Q4616_3.jpg", "Q4616_4.jpg", "Q4616_5.JPG", "Q4616_6.jpg", "Q4616_7.jpg", "Q4616_8.jpg", "Q4616_9.jpg", "Q4616_10.png", "Q4616_11.jpg", "Q4616_12.svg", "Q4616_13.jpg", "Q4616_14.jpg", "Q4616_15.JPG", "Q4616_16.jpg", "Q4616_17.jpg", "Q4616_18.jpg", "Q4616_19.jpg", "Q4616_20.jpg", "Q4616_21.jpg", "Q4616_22.jpg", "Q4616_23.jpg", "Q4616_24.jpg", "Q4616_25.jpg", "Q4616_26.jpg", "Q4616_27.jpeg", "Q4616_28.jpg", "Q4616_29.svg", "Q4616_30.svg", "Q4616_33.jpg", "Q4616_34.jpg", "Q4616_35.jpg"], "summary": "Marilyn Monroe:Sex: female.

An Islamist affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood organisation, Morsi led the Freedom and Justice Party from 2011 to 2012.\nMorsi was born in El Adwah, Sharqia Governorate before studying metallurgical engineering at Cairo University and then materials science at the University of Southern California. He became an associate professor at California State University, Northridge from 1982 to 1985 before returning to Egypt to teach at Zagazig University. Associating with the Muslim Brotherhood, which was then barred from office under President Hosni Mubarak, Morsi stood as an independent candidate for the 2000 parliamentary elections. Following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, which resulted in Mubarak's resignation, Morsi came to the forefront as head of the Freedom and Justice Party. It became the largest party in the 2011\u201312 parliamentary election and Morsi was elected president in the 2012 presidential election.\nAs president, Morsi issued a temporary constitutional declaration in November 2012 that in effect granted him unlimited powers and the power to legislate without judicial oversight or review of his acts as a pre-emptive move against the expected dissolution of the second constituent assembly by the Mubarak-era judges. The new constitution that was then hastily finalised by the Islamist-dominated constitutional assembly, presented to the president, and scheduled for a referendum before the Supreme Constitutional Court could rule on the constitutionality of the assembly, was described by independent press agencies not aligned with the regime as an \"Islamist coup\". These issues, along with complaints of prosecutions of journalists and attacks on nonviolent demonstrators, led to the 2012 protests. As part of a compromise, Morsi rescinded the decrees. A new constitution was approved by approximately two-thirds of voters in the referendum.In June 2013, protests calling for Morsi's resignation erupted. The military, backed by the political opposition and leading religious figures, stepped in and deposed Morsi in a coup. It suspended the constitution and appointed Adly Mansour as interim president. Pro-Morsi demonstrations were crushed, resulting in over 800 deaths. Egyptian prosecutors then charged Morsi with various crimes and sought the death penalty, a move denounced by Amnesty International as \"a charade based on null and void procedures\". His death sentence was overturned in November 2016 and a retrial ordered. Morsi died during trial on 17 June 2019 amid claims that he was being denied appropriate medical care while in custody.", "img_list": ["Q4631_0.jpg", "Q4631_1.jpg", "Q4631_2.svg", "Q4631_3.JPG", "Q4631_4.svg", "Q4631_5.svg", "Q4631_6.jpg", "Q4631_7.svg", "Q4631_8.png", "Q4631_9.jpg", "Q4631_10.jpg", "Q4631_11.svg", "Q4631_12.svg", "Q4631_13.svg", "Q4631_14.svg", "Q4631_15.svg"], "summary": "Mohamed Morsi:Sex: male.

He undertook sweeping progressive reforms, which modernized Turkey into a secular, industrializing nation. Ideologically a secularist and nationalist, his policies and socio-political theories became known as Kemalism. Due to his military and political accomplishments, Atat\u00fcrk is regarded as one of the most important political leaders of the 20th century.Atat\u00fcrk came to prominence for his role in securing the Ottoman Turkish victory at the Battle of Gallipoli (1915) during World War I. Following the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, he led the Turkish National Movement, which resisted mainland Turkey's partition among the victorious Allied powers. Establishing a provisional government in the present-day Turkish capital Ankara (known in English at the time as Angora), he defeated the forces sent by the Allies, thus emerging victorious from what was later referred to as the Turkish War of Independence. He subsequently proceeded to abolish the decrepit Ottoman Empire and proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish Republic in its place.\nAs the president of the newly formed Turkish Republic, Atat\u00fcrk initiated a rigorous program of political, economic, and cultural reforms with the ultimate aim of building a modern, progressive and secular nation-state. He made primary education free and compulsory, opening thousands of new schools all over the country. He also introduced the Latin-based Turkish alphabet, replacing the old Ottoman Turkish alphabet. Turkish women received equal civil and political rights during Atat\u00fcrk's presidency. In particular, women were given voting rights in local elections by Act no. 1580 on 3 April 1930 and a few years later, in 1934, full universal suffrage.His government carried out a policy of Turkification, trying to create a homogeneous and unified nation. Under Atat\u00fcrk, non-Turkish minorities were pressured to speak Turkish in public; non-Turkish toponyms and last names of minorities had to be changed to Turkish renditions. The Turkish Parliament granted him the surname Atat\u00fcrk in 1934, which means \"Father of the Turks\", in recognition of the role he played in building the modern Turkish Republic. He died on 10 November 1938 at Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in Istanbul, at the age of 57; he was succeeded as President by his long-time Prime Minister \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and was honored with a state funeral. His iconic mausoleum in Ankara, built and opened in 1953, is surrounded by a park called the Peace Park in honor of his famous expression \"Peace at Home, Peace in the World\".\nIn 1981, the centennial of Atat\u00fcrk's birth, his memory was honoured by the United Nations and UNESCO, which declared it The Atat\u00fcrk Year in the World and adopted the Resolution on the Atat\u00fcrk Centennial, describing him as \"the leader of the first struggle given against colonialism and imperialism\" and a \"remarkable promoter of the sense of understanding between peoples and durable peace between the nations of the world and that he worked all his life for the development of harmony and cooperation between peoples without distinction\". Atat\u00fcrk is commemorated by many memorials and places named in his honor in Turkey and throughout the world.", "img_list": ["Q5152_0.jpg", "Q5152_1.JPG", "Q5152_2.jpg", "Q5152_3.jpg", "Q5152_4.jpg", "Q5152_5.JPG", "Q5152_6.jpg", "Q5152_7.jpg", "Q5152_8.jpg", "Q5152_9.jpg", "Q5152_10.jpg", "Q5152_11.png", "Q5152_12.png", "Q5152_13.png", "Q5152_14.png", "Q5152_15.jpg", "Q5152_16.png", "Q5152_17.jpg", "Q5152_18.jpg", "Q5152_19.jpg", "Q5152_20.jpg", "Q5152_21.png", "Q5152_22.jpg", "Q5152_23.jpg", "Q5152_24.jpg", "Q5152_25.jpg", "Q5152_26.svg", "Q5152_27.svg", "Q5152_28.ogg", "Q5152_29.jpg", "Q5152_30.jpg", "Q5152_31.svg", "Q5152_32.svg", "Q5152_33.svg", "Q5152_34.svg", "Q5152_35.svg", "Q5152_36.svg", "Q5152_37.svg", "Q5152_38.svg", "Q5152_39.svg", "Q5152_40.svg", "Q5152_41.png", "Q5152_42.svg", "Q5152_43.ogg", "Q5152_44.png", "Q5152_45.jpg", "Q5152_46.jpg", "Q5152_47.svg", "Q5152_48.jpg", "Q5152_49.png", "Q5152_50.png", "Q5152_51.png", "Q5152_52.jpg", "Q5152_53.jpg", "Q5152_54.png", "Q5152_55.jpg", "Q5152_56.png", "Q5152_57.jpg", "Q5152_58.jpg", "Q5152_59.jpg", "Q5152_60.jpg", "Q5152_61.png", "Q5152_62.jpg", "Q5152_63.svg", "Q5152_64.png", "Q5152_65.jpg", "Q5152_67.jpg", "Q5152_68.svg", "Q5152_69.jpg", "Q5152_70.svg", "Q5152_71.jpg", "Q5152_79.svg"], "summary": "Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk:Sex: male.

He was the de facto leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. He was one of the greatest military commanders in history, and his wars and campaigns are studied in military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has endured, and he has been one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in world history.Napoleon was born on the island of Corsica not long after its annexation by the Kingdom of France, and his family \"occupied that social penumbra encompassing the haute bourgeoisie and the very minor nobility.\" He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the governing French Directory by firing on royalist insurgents. In April 1796, he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, scoring a series of decisive victories and becoming a national hero. Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic. Intractable differences with the British meant that the French were facing the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign, and a historic triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolving of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because Prussia became worried about growing French influence on the continent. Napoleon quickly knocked out Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, then marched the Grande Arm\u00e9e deep into Eastern Europe, annihilating the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, and forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War of the Fifth Coalition, but Napoleon solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.\nHoping to extend the Continental System (his embargo against Britain), Napoleon invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support in the Peninsular War, which lasted six years, featured brutal guerrilla warfare, and culminated in a defeat for Napoleon's marshals. Napoleon launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Napoleon's Grande Arm\u00e9e and encouraged his enemies. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign culminated in a large coalition army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Napoleon to abdicate in April 1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. Meanwhile, in France, the Bourbons were restored to power. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba in February 1815 and took control of France, \"without spilling a drop of blood\" as he wished. The Allies responded by forming a Seventh Coalition, which ultimately defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51. Napoleon had an extensive impact on the modern world, bringing liberal reforms to the numerous territories that he conquered and controlled, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented fundamental liberal policies in France and throughout Western Europe.", "img_list": ["Q517_0.jpg", "Q517_1.jpg", "Q517_2.png", "Q517_3.jpg", "Q517_4.jpg", "Q517_5.svg", "Q517_6.svg", "Q517_7.svg", "Q517_8.jpg", "Q517_9.png", "Q517_10.jpg", "Q517_11.jpg", "Q517_12.jpg", "Q517_13.jpg", "Q517_14.jpg", "Q517_15.jpg", "Q517_16.png", "Q517_17.jpg", "Q517_18.jpg", "Q517_19.jpg", "Q517_20.jpg", "Q517_21.svg", "Q517_22.svg", "Q517_23.svg", "Q517_24.svg", "Q517_25.svg", "Q517_26.svg", "Q517_27.svg", "Q517_28.svg", "Q517_29.svg", "Q517_30.svg", "Q517_31.svg", "Q517_32.jpg", "Q517_33.svg", "Q517_34.jpeg", "Q517_35.jpg", "Q517_36.svg", "Q517_37.svg", "Q517_38.jpg", "Q517_39.svg", "Q517_40.jpg", "Q517_41.jpg", "Q517_42.jpg", "Q517_43.jpg", "Q517_44.jpg", "Q517_45.jpg", "Q517_46.jpg", "Q517_47.jpg", "Q517_48.png", "Q517_49.jpg", "Q517_50.jpg", "Q517_51.jpg", "Q517_52.jpg", "Q517_53.jpg", "Q517_54.jpg", "Q517_55.PNG", "Q517_56.jpg", "Q517_57.jpg", "Q517_58.jpg", "Q517_59.jpg", "Q517_60.jpg", "Q517_61.jpg", "Q517_62.jpg", "Q517_63.jpg", "Q517_64.jpg", "Q517_65.jpg", "Q517_66.jpg", "Q517_67.svg", "Q517_68.jpg", "Q517_69.JPG", "Q517_70.svg", "Q517_71.jpg", "Q517_72.svg", "Q517_73.svg", "Q517_74.svg", "Q517_75.svg", "Q517_76.svg", "Q517_78.jpg", "Q517_81.jpg", "Q517_82.jpg", "Q517_83.jpg", "Q517_84.jpg", "Q517_85.jpg", "Q517_87.jpg", "Q517_89.jpg"], "summary": "Napoleon:Sex: male.

He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.\nGates was born and raised in Seattle, Washington. In 1975, he and Allen founded Microsoft in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It became the world's largest personal computer software company. Gates led the company as chairman and CEO until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, succeeded by Steve Ballmer, but he remained chairman of the board of directors and became chief software architect. During the late 1990s, he was criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. In June 2008, Gates transitioned to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation he and his then-wife, Melinda Gates, established in 2000. He stepped down as chairman of the board of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella. In March 2020, Gates left his board positions at Microsoft and Berkshire Hathaway to focus on his philanthropic efforts including climate change, global health and development, and education.Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people. From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to 2013. In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time. As of January 2022, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$139 billion, making him the fourth-richest person in the world.Later in his career and since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft in 2008, Gates has pursued many business and philanthropic endeavors. He is the founder and chairman of several companies, including BEN, Cascade Investment, bgC3, and TerraPower. He has given sizable amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity. Through the foundation, he led an early 21st century vaccination campaign that significantly contributed to the eradication of the wild poliovirus in Africa. In 2010, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.", "img_list": ["Q5284_0.jpg", "Q5284_1.jpg", "Q5284_2.svg", "Q5284_3.jpg", "Q5284_4.jpg", "Q5284_5.jpg", "Q5284_6.jpg", "Q5284_7.svg", "Q5284_8.JPG", "Q5284_9.svg", "Q5284_10.svg", "Q5284_11.svg", "Q5284_12.svg", "Q5284_13.jpg", "Q5284_14.svg", "Q5284_15.svg", "Q5284_16.jpg", "Q5284_18.svg", "Q5284_19.jpg", "Q5284_20.svg", "Q5284_21.jpg", "Q5284_22.png", "Q5284_23.jpg", "Q5284_24.svg", "Q5284_25.svg", "Q5284_26.svg", "Q5284_27.svg", "Q5284_28.svg"], "summary": "Bill Gates:Sex: male.

During a literary career that spanned more than sixty years, he wrote abundantly in an exceptional variety of genres: lyrics, satires, epics, philosophical poems, epigrams, novels, history, critical essays, political speeches, funeral orations, diaries, and letters public and private, as well as dramas in verse and prose.\nHugo is considered to be one of the greatest and best-known French writers. Outside France, his most famous works are the novels Les Mis\u00e9rables, 1862, and The Hunchback of Notre-Dame (French: Notre-Dame de Paris), 1831. In France, Hugo is renowned for his poetry collections, such as Les Contemplations (The Contemplations) and La L\u00e9gende des si\u00e8cles (The Legend of the Ages). Hugo was at the forefront of the Romantic literary movement with his play Cromwell and drama Hernani. Many of his works have inspired music, both during his lifetime and after his death, including the musicals Les Mis\u00e9rables and Notre-Dame de Paris. He produced more than 4,000 drawings in his lifetime, and campaigned for social causes such as the abolition of capital punishment.\nThough he was a committed royalist when young, Hugo's views changed as the decades passed, and he became a passionate supporter of republicanism serving in politics as both deputy and senator. His work touched upon most of the political and social issues and the artistic trends of his time.

A leading figure in the music industry, Bowie is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.\nBowie developed an interest in music as a child. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. \"Space Oddity\", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single \"Starman\" and album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as \"plastic soul\", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single \"Fame\" and the album Young Americans. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film The Man Who Fell to Earth and released Station to Station. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album Low, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the \"Berlin Trilogy\". \"Heroes\" (1977) and Lodger (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.\nAfter uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single \"Ashes to Ashes\", its album Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps), and \"Under Pressure\" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He reached his peak commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance: its title track topped both the UK and US charts. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting: his roles included Major Jack Celliers in Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in Labyrinth (1986), Pontius Pilate in The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), and Nikola Tesla in The Prestige (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with The Next Day. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, Blackstar (2016).\nDuring his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Rolling Stone named him among the greatest artists in history and \u2013 after his death \u2013 the \"greatest rock star ever\".", "img_list": ["Q5383_0.svg", "Q5383_1.jpg", "Q5383_2.jpg", "Q5383_3.jpg", "Q5383_4.jpg", "Q5383_5.jpg", "Q5383_6.jpg", "Q5383_7.jpeg", "Q5383_8.png", "Q5383_9.jpg", "Q5383_10.png", "Q5383_11.jpg", "Q5383_12.jpg", "Q5383_13.JPG", "Q5383_14.JPG", "Q5383_15.jpg", "Q5383_16.jpg", "Q5383_17.jpg", "Q5383_18.jpg", "Q5383_19.svg", "Q5383_20.jpg", "Q5383_21.jpg", "Q5383_22.jpg", "Q5383_23.svg", "Q5383_24.png", "Q5383_25.jpg", "Q5383_26.svg", "Q5383_27.svg", "Q5383_30.jpg", "Q5383_33.jpg"], "summary": "David Bowie:Sex: male.

He contributed to Italian unification and the creation of the Kingdom of Italy. He is considered one of the greatest generals of modern times and one of Italy's \"fathers of the fatherland\", along with Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and Giuseppe Mazzini. Garibaldi is also known as the \"Hero of the Two Worlds\" because of his military enterprises in South America and Europe.Garibaldi was a follower of the Italian nationalist Mazzini and embraced the republican nationalism of the Young Italy movement. He became a supporter of Italian unification under a democratic republican government. However, breaking with Mazzini, he pragmatically allied himself with the monarchist Cavour and Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia in the struggle for independence, subordinating his republican ideals to his nationalist ones until Italy was unified. After participating in an uprising in Piedmont, he was sentenced to death, but escaped and sailed to South America, where he spent 14 years in exile, during which he took part in several wars and learnt the art of guerrilla warfare. In 1835 he joined the rebels known as the Ragamuffins (farrapos), in the Ragamuffin War in Brazil, and took up their cause of establishing the Riograndense Republic and later the Catarinense Republic. Garibaldi also became involved in the Uruguayan Civil War, raising an Italian force known as Redshirts and is still celebrated as an important contributor to Uruguay's reconstitution.\nIn 1848, Garibaldi returned to Italy and commanded and fought in military campaigns that eventually led to Italian unification. The provisional government of Milan made him a general and the Minister of War promoted him to General of the Roman Republic in 1849. When the war of independence broke out in April 1859, he led his Hunters of the Alps in the capture of major cities in Lombardy, including Varese and Como, and reached the frontier of South Tyrol; the war ended with the acquisition of Lombardy. The following year, he led the Expedition of the Thousand on behalf of and with the consent of Victor Emmanuel II. The expedition was a success and concluded with the annexation of Sicily, Southern Italy, Marche and Umbria to the Kingdom of Sardinia before the creation of a unified Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861. His last military campaign took place during the Franco-Prussian War as commander of the Army of the Vosges.\nGaribaldi became an international figurehead for national independence and republican ideals, and is considered by the twentieth-century historiography and popular culture as Italy's greatest national hero.

She was known for her melancholic, somber persona due to her many film portrayals of tragic characters and for her subtle and understated performances. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Garbo fifth on its list of the greatest female stars of classic Hollywood cinema.\nGarbo launched her career with a secondary role in the 1924 Swedish film The Saga of G\u00f6sta Berling. Her performance caught the attention of Louis B. Mayer, chief executive of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), who brought her to Hollywood in 1925. She stirred interest with her first American silent film, Torrent (1926). Garbo's performance in Flesh and the Devil (1927), her third movie, made her an international star. In 1928, Garbo starred in A Woman of Affairs, which catapulted her at MGM to its highest box-office star, usurping the long reigning Lillian Gish. Other well-known Garbo films from the silent era are The Mysterious Lady (1928), The Single Standard (1929) and The Kiss (1929).\nWith Garbo's first sound film, Anna Christie (1930), MGM marketers enticed the public with the tagline \"Garbo talks!\" That same year she starred in Romance and for her performances in both films she received the first of three nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. By 1932 her success allowed her to dictate the terms of her contracts and she became increasingly selective about her roles. She continued in films such as Mata Hari (1931), Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise) (1931), Grand Hotel (1932), Queen Christina (1933) and Anna Karenina (1935).\nMany critics and film historians consider her performance as the doomed courtesan Marguerite Gautier in Camille (1936) to be her finest and the role gained her a second Academy Award nomination. However, Garbo's career soon declined and she became one of many stars labeled box office poison in 1938. Her career revived with a turn to comedy in Ninotchka (1939) which earned her a third Academy Award nomination. But after the failure of Two-Faced Woman (1941), she retired from the screen at the age of 35 after acting in 28 films.\nAfter retiring, Garbo declined all opportunities to return to the screen and, shunning publicity, led a private life. She became an art collector whose collection, though containing many works of negligible value, included works from Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pierre Bonnard and Kees van Dongen, which were worth millions of dollars when she died.", "img_list": ["Q5443_0.jpg", "Q5443_1.jpg", "Q5443_2.jpg", "Q5443_3.JPG", "Q5443_4.jpg", "Q5443_5.jpg", "Q5443_6.jpg", "Q5443_7.jpg", "Q5443_8.svg", "Q5443_9.svg", "Q5443_10.jpg", "Q5443_11.jpg", "Q5443_12.jpg", "Q5443_13.ogg", "Q5443_14.jpg", "Q5443_15.svg"], "summary": "Greta Garbo:Sex: female.

Influenced by Impressionism and the Renaissance masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to Cubism and avant-garde movements. He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the Spanish Civil War (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Spain in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism, and recent scientific developments.Dal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior often drew more attention than his artwork. His public support for the Francoist regime, his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial. His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, pop art and contemporary artists such as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst.There are two major museums devoted to Salvador Dal\u00ed's work: the Dal\u00ed Theatre-Museum in Figueres, Spain, and the Salvador Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.", "img_list": ["Q5577_0.jpg", "Q5577_1.jpg", "Q5577_2.jpg", "Q5577_3.jpg", "Q5577_4.jpg", "Q5577_5.jpg", "Q5577_6.JPG", "Q5577_7.JPG", "Q5577_8.jpg", "Q5577_9.jpg", "Q5577_10.jpg", "Q5577_11.jpg", "Q5577_12.jpg", "Q5577_13.jpg", "Q5577_14.jpg", "Q5577_15.jpg", "Q5577_16.jpg", "Q5577_17.jpg", "Q5577_18.jpg", "Q5577_19.svg", "Q5577_20.svg", "Q5577_23.JPG", "Q5577_26.jpg"], "summary": "Salvador Dal\u00ed:Sex: male.

Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time.Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass, and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres. \nAfter his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of Relapse (2009) and Recovery was released the following year. Recovery was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music to Be Murdered By (2020).\nEminem made his debut in the film industry with the musical drama film 8 Mile (2002), playing a fictionalized version of himself, and his track \"Lose Yourself\" from its soundtrack won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films The Wash (2001), Funny People (2009) and The Interview (2014) and the television series Entourage (2010). He has also developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio. In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9\"; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.\nHe was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. Billboard named him the \"Artist of the Decade (2000\u20132009)\". The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, \"Lose Yourself\", \"Love the Way You Lie\" and \"Not Afraid\" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, an Academy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award.

One of the leading figures of the Romantic movement, Byron is regarded as one of the greatest English language poets. He remains widely read and influential. Among his best-known works are the lengthy narrative poems Don Juan and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage; many of his shorter lyrics in Hebrew Melodies also became popular.\nHe travelled extensively across Europe, especially in Italy, where he lived for seven years in the cities of Venice, Ravenna, and Pisa. During his stay in Italy he frequently visited his friend and fellow poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Later in life Byron joined the Greek War of Independence fighting the Ottoman Empire and died leading a campaign during that war, for which Greeks revere him as a folk hero. He died in 1824 at the age of 36 from a fever contracted after the First and Second Siege of Missolonghi.\nHis only marital child, Ada Lovelace, is regarded as a foundational figure in the field of computer programming based on her notes for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.

A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she previously served as leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the CDU from 2000 to 2018. Merkel was the first female chancellor of Germany. During her tenure as Chancellor, Merkel was frequently referred to as the de facto leader of the European Union (EU) and the most powerful woman in the world.Merkel was born in Hamburg in then-West Germany, moving to East Germany as an infant when her father, a Lutheran clergyman, received a pastorate in Perleberg. She obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989. Merkel entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly serving as deputy spokesperson for the first democratically elected Government of East Germany led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991, later becoming Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After the CDU lost the 1998 federal election, Merkel was elected CDU General Secretary, before becoming the party's first female leader and the first female Leader of the Opposition two years later, in the aftermath of a donations scandal that toppled Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble.\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Merkel was appointed to succeed Gerhard Schr\u00f6der as Chancellor of Germany, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, its Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Merkel was the first woman to be elected as Chancellor, and the first Chancellor since reunification to have been raised in the former East Germany. At the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel was able to form a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP). At the 2013 federal election, Merkel's CDU won a landslide victory with 41.5% of the vote and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. At the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time; Merkel formed a third grand coalition with the SPD and was sworn in for a joint-record fourth term as Chancellor on 14 March 2018.In foreign policy, Merkel has emphasised international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and NATO, and strengthening transatlantic economic relations. In 2008, Merkel served as President of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel played a crucial role in managing the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 and the European debt crisis. She negotiated the 2008 European Union stimulus plan focusing on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel's Energiewende program has focused on future energy development, seeking to phase out nuclear power in Germany, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and increase renewable energy sources. Reforms to the Bundeswehr which abolished conscription, health care reform, and her government's response to the 2010s European migrant crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany were major issues during her chancellorship. She served as the senior G7 leader from 2011 to 2012 and again from 2014 to 2021. In 2014 she became the longest-serving incumbent head of government in the EU. In October 2018, Merkel announced that she would stand down as Leader of the CDU at the party convention, and would not seek a fifth term as Chancellor in the 2021 federal election.", "img_list": ["Q567_0.jpg", "Q567_1.jpg", "Q567_2.svg", "Q567_3.png", "Q567_4.jpg", "Q567_5.jpg", "Q567_6.jpg", "Q567_7.jpg", "Q567_8.jpg", "Q567_9.svg", "Q567_10.jpg", "Q567_11.jpg", "Q567_12.jpg", "Q567_13.svg", "Q567_14.jpg", "Q567_15.svg", "Q567_16.jpg", "Q567_17.svg", "Q567_18.svg", "Q567_19.ogg", "Q567_20.svg", "Q567_21.svg", "Q567_22.svg", "Q567_23.svg", "Q567_24.jpg", "Q567_25.jpg", "Q567_26.png", "Q567_27.jpg", "Q567_28.svg", "Q567_29.svg", "Q567_30.svg", "Q567_31.svg", "Q567_32.svg", "Q567_33.svg", "Q567_34.svg", "Q567_35.svg", "Q567_36.svg", "Q567_37.svg", "Q567_38.svg", "Q567_39.svg", "Q567_40.svg", "Q567_41.svg", "Q567_42.svg", "Q567_43.svg", "Q567_44.svg", "Q567_45.svg", "Q567_46.svg", "Q567_47.svg", "Q567_48.svg", "Q567_49.svg", "Q567_50.jpg", "Q567_51.svg", "Q567_52.jpg", "Q567_53.png", "Q567_54.svg", "Q567_55.jpg", "Q567_56.SVG", "Q567_57.jpg", "Q567_58.jpg", "Q567_59.png", "Q567_60.png", "Q567_61.png", "Q567_62.svg", "Q567_63.svg", "Q567_64.svg", "Q567_65.jpg", "Q567_66.jpg", "Q567_67.png", "Q567_68.png", "Q567_69.png", "Q567_70.png", "Q567_71.png", "Q567_72.svg", "Q567_73.jpg", "Q567_74.jpg", "Q567_75.jpg", "Q567_76.svg", "Q567_77.jpg", "Q567_78.png", "Q567_79.svg", "Q567_80.svg", "Q567_81.jpg", "Q567_82.svg", "Q567_83.svg", "Q567_84.svg", "Q567_85.svg", "Q567_86.svg", "Q567_87.svg"], "summary": "Angela Merkel:Sex: female.

His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics. Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre. Chekhov was a doctor by profession. \"Medicine is my lawful wife\", he once said, \"and literature is my mistress.\"Chekhov renounced the theatre after the reception of The Seagull in 1896, but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Konstantin Stanislavski's Moscow Art Theatre, which subsequently also produced Chekhov's Uncle Vanya and premiered his last two plays, Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard. These four works present a challenge to the acting ensemble as well as to audiences, because in place of conventional action Chekhov offers a \"theatre of mood\" and a \"submerged life in the text\".Chekhov had at first written stories to earn money, but as his artistic ambition grew, he made formal innovations which have influenced the evolution of the modern short story.

He then served as Chief of State of Vichy France from 1940 to 1944. P\u00e9tain, who was 84 years old in 1940, ranks as France's oldest head of state.\nDuring World War I, P\u00e9tain led the French Army to victory at the nine-month-long Battle of Verdun. After the failed Nivelle Offensive and subsequent mutinies he was appointed Commander-in-Chief and succeeded in repairing the army's confidence. P\u00e9tain remained in command for the rest of the war and emerged as a national hero. During the interwar period he was head of the peacetime French Army, commanded joint Franco-Spanish operations during the Rif War and served twice as a government minister. During this time he was known as le vieux Mar\u00e9chal (The Old Marshal).\nWith the imminent Fall of France and the Cabinet wanting to ask for an armistice, on 17 June 1940 Prime Minister Paul Reynaud resigned, recommending to President Lebrun that he appoint Marshal Petain in his place, which he did that day, while the government was at Bordeaux. The Cabinet then resolved to sign armistice agreements with Germany and Italy. The entire government subsequently moved briefly to Clermont-Ferrand, then to the spa town of Vichy in central France.  The government voted to transform the discredited French Third Republic into the French State or Vichy France, an authoritarian regime that remained officially neutral in World War II but collaborated with the Axis. After Germany and Italy occupied and disarmed France in November 1942, P\u00e9tain's government worked very closely with Nazi Germany's military administration.\nAfter the war, P\u00e9tain was tried and convicted for treason.  He was originally sentenced to death, but due to his age and World War I service his sentence was commuted to life in prison. His journey from military obscurity, to hero of France during World War I, to collaborationist ruler during World War II, led his successor Charles de Gaulle to write that P\u00e9tain's life was \"successively banal, then glorious, then deplorable, but never mediocre\".", "img_list": ["Q5721_0.jpg", "Q5721_1.svg", "Q5721_2.svg", "Q5721_3.svg", "Q5721_4.svg", "Q5721_5.svg", "Q5721_6.jpg", "Q5721_7.jpg", "Q5721_8.svg", "Q5721_9.svg", "Q5721_10.svg", "Q5721_11.svg", "Q5721_12.svg", "Q5721_13.svg", "Q5721_14.svg", "Q5721_15.svg", "Q5721_16.svg", "Q5721_17.svg", "Q5721_18.svg", "Q5721_19.svg", "Q5721_20.svg", "Q5721_21.svg", "Q5721_22.svg", "Q5721_23.svg", "Q5721_24.jpg", "Q5721_25.jpg", "Q5721_26.jpg", "Q5721_27.jpg", "Q5721_28.jpg", "Q5721_29.jpg", "Q5721_30.svg", "Q5721_31.svg", "Q5721_32.jpg", "Q5721_33.svg", "Q5721_34.svg", "Q5721_35.JPG"], "summary": "Philippe P\u00e9tain:Sex: male.

He was the second elected President of France, and the first President of the French Third Republic.\nThiers was a key figure in the July Revolution of 1830, which overthrew King Charles X in favor of the more liberal King Louis Philippe, and the French Revolution of 1848, which overthrew the Bourbon monarchy and established the Second French Republic. He served as a prime minister in 1836 and 1840, dedicated the Arc de Triomphe, and arranged the return to France of the remains of Napoleon from Saint-Helena. He was first a supporter, then a vocal opponent of Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (who served from 1848 to 1852 as President of the Second Republic and then reigned as Emperor Napoleon III from 1852 to 1871). When Napoleon III seized power, Thiers was arrested and briefly expelled from France. He then returned and became an opponent of the government.\nFollowing the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, which Thiers opposed, he was elected chief executive of the new French government and negotiated the end of the war. When the Paris Commune seized power in March 1871, Thiers gave the orders to the army for its suppression. At the age of seventy-four, he was named President of the Republic by the French National Assembly in August 1871. His chief accomplishment as president was to achieve the departure of German soldiers from most of French territory two years ahead of schedule. Opposed by the monarchists in the French assembly and the left wing of the Republicans, he resigned on 24 May 1873, and was replaced as president by Patrice de MacMahon. When he died in 1877, his funeral became a major political event; the procession was led by two of the leaders of the republican movement, Victor Hugo and L\u00e9on Gambetta, who, at the time of his death, were his allies against the conservative monarchists.\nHe was also a notable popular historian. He wrote the first large scale history of the French revolution in 10 volumes, published 1823\u20131827. Historian Robert Tombs states it was, \"A bold political act during the Bourbon Restoration...and it formed part of an intellectual upsurge of liberals against the counter-revolutionary offensive of the Ultra Royalists.\" He also wrote a twenty-volume history of the Consulate and Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte (Histoire du Consulat et de l'Empire). In 1834 he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise.", "img_list": ["Q5738_0.jpg", "Q5738_1.svg", "Q5738_2.jpg", "Q5738_3.JPG", "Q5738_4.jpg", "Q5738_5.jpg", "Q5738_6.JPG", "Q5738_7.JPG", "Q5738_8.jpg", "Q5738_9.jpg", "Q5738_10.jpg", "Q5738_11.jpg", "Q5738_12.jpg", "Q5738_13.PNG", "Q5738_14.jpg", "Q5738_15.jpg", "Q5738_16.JPG", "Q5738_17.jpg", "Q5738_18.jpg", "Q5738_19.jpg", "Q5738_20.jpg", "Q5738_21.jpg", "Q5738_22.jpg", "Q5738_23.png", "Q5738_24.jpg", "Q5738_25.jpg", "Q5738_26.jpg", "Q5738_27.svg", "Q5738_28.jpg", "Q5738_29.jpg", "Q5738_30.jpg", "Q5738_31.jpg", "Q5738_32.JPG", "Q5738_33.svg", "Q5738_34.jpg"], "summary": "Adolphe Thiers:Sex: male.

He spent the next 41 years in exile in Switzerland, France (where he was imprisoned for almost four years) and England. While in exile, he gave lectures and published widely on anarchism and geography. Kropotkin returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution in 1917, but he was disappointed by the Bolshevik state.\nKropotkin was a proponent of a decentralised communist society free from central government and based on voluntary associations of self-governing communities and worker-run enterprises. He wrote many books, pamphlets and articles, the most prominent being The Conquest of Bread and Fields, Factories and Workshops, but also Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution, his principal scientific offering. He contributed the article on anarchism to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition and left unfinished a work on anarchist ethical philosophy.", "img_list": ["Q5752_0.svg", "Q5752_1.svg", "Q5752_2.svg", "Q5752_3.svg", "Q5752_4.jpg", "Q5752_5.jpg", "Q5752_6.png", "Q5752_7.jpg", "Q5752_8.svg", "Q5752_9.jpg", "Q5752_10.svg", "Q5752_11.png", "Q5752_12.jpg", "Q5752_13.svg", "Q5752_14.svg", "Q5752_15.svg", "Q5752_16.svg", "Q5752_17.svg", "Q5752_18.svg", "Q5752_19.svg", "Q5752_20.svg", "Q5752_21.svg", "Q5752_22.svg", "Q5752_23.svg", "Q5752_24.svg", "Q5752_25.jpg", "Q5752_26.png"], "summary": "Peter Kropotkin:Sex: male.

In the 100 m, her signature event, she is a two-time Olympic gold medallist and a four-time world champion. In the 200 m, she has won an Olympic silver medal and World Championship gold.\nAn eight-time Olympic medallist, she rose to prominence at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, becoming the first Caribbean woman to win gold in the 100 m. At the 2012 London Olympics, she became one of only four women in history to defend an Olympic 100 m title. After injury affected her season, she won bronze at the 2016 Rio Olympics. Thirteen years after her first Olympic win, she won a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, becoming the first athlete to medal in the 100 m at four consecutive Olympic Games.\nAt the World Athletics Championships, Fraser-Pryce is one of the most decorated athletes in history, winning ten gold (including one indoor title) and two silver.

Her racing repertoire also spans the 100 meters, 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay, and 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay. At 200 meters, she is the 2012 Olympic champion, a three-time world champion (2005\u20132009), a two-time Olympic silver medalist (2004 and 2008), and the 2011 world bronze medalist. At 400 meters, she is the 2015 world champion, 2011 world silver medalist, 2016 Olympic silver medalist, 2017 world bronze medalist, and 2020 Olympic bronze medalist.\nAlthough individual Olympic glory was mostly elusive, Felix played a key role on the United States women's relay teams, winning six additional Olympic gold medals: four consecutive medals at 4 \u00d7 400 meters (2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020), and two at 4 \u00d7 100 meters (2012 and 2016). The 2012 U.S. Olympic 4 \u00d7 100 meters team also set the current women's 4 \u00d7 100 meters world record. With these six golds from team relays and one from an individual event, Felix became the first female track and field athlete to ever win seven Olympic gold medals.  She is also the most decorated woman in Olympic track and field history and the most decorated American track and field athlete in Olympic history, having earned 11 total medals from five consecutive Olympic Games. Felix currently holds the title of the most decorated athlete, male or female, in World Athletics Championship history with 18 career medals, 7 from individual events and 11 from team relays.Amongst Felix's notable performances, her 200 meters personal best of 21.69 seconds, which was set at the 2012 U.S. Olympic trials, ranked at the time as the third-fastest time ever ran by an American woman and sixth-fastest time by a female athlete in history. She also ran a 47.72-second leg on the U.S. women's 4 \u00d7 400 meters relay team at the 2015 Beijing World Championships, recording the fastest split ever by an American woman, and third-fastest split ever by a female athlete.Felix, along with Alysia Monta\u00f1o and Kara Goucher, is credited with stirring public outcry over Nike's refusal to guarantee salary protections for its pregnant athletes, prompting the sportswear brand to subsequently expand its maternal policy in 2019.

A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.As a young medical student, Guevara traveled throughout South America and was radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease he witnessed. His burgeoning desire to help overturn what he saw as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompted his involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, whose eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidified Guevara's political ideology. Later in Mexico City, Guevara met Ra\u00fal and Fidel Castro, joined their 26th of July Movement, and sailed to Cuba aboard the yacht Granma with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Guevara soon rose to prominence among the insurgents, was promoted to second-in-command, and played a pivotal role in the two-year guerrilla campaign that deposed the Batista regime.Following the Cuban Revolution, Guevara performed a number of key roles in the new government. These included reviewing the appeals and firing squads for those convicted as war criminals during the revolutionary tribunals, instituting agrarian land reform as minister of industries, helping spearhead a successful nationwide literacy campaign, serving as both national bank president and instructional director for Cuba's armed forces, and traversing the globe as a diplomat on behalf of Cuban socialism. Such positions also allowed him to play a central role in training the militia forces who repelled the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and bringing Soviet nuclear-armed ballistic missiles to Cuba, which preceded the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Additionally, Guevara was a prolific writer and diarist, composing a seminal guerrilla warfare manual, along with a best-selling memoir about his youthful continental motorcycle journey. His experiences and studying of Marxism\u2013Leninism led him to posit that the Third World's underdevelopment and dependence was an intrinsic result of imperialism, neocolonialism, and monopoly capitalism, with the only remedy being proletarian internationalism and world revolution. Guevara left Cuba in 1965 to foment continental revolutions across both Africa and South America, first unsuccessfully in Congo-Kinshasa and later in Bolivia, where he was captured by CIA-assisted Bolivian forces and summarily executed.Guevara remains both a revered and reviled historical figure, polarized in the collective imagination in a multitude of biographies, memoirs, essays, documentaries, songs, and films. As a result of his perceived martyrdom, poetic invocations for class struggle, and desire to create the consciousness of a \"new man\" driven by moral rather than material incentives, Guevara has evolved into a quintessential icon of various leftist movements. In contrast, his ideological critics on the right accuse him of promoting authoritarianism and endorsing violence against his political opponents. Despite disagreements on his legacy, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century, while an Alberto Korda photograph of him, titled Guerrillero Heroico, was cited by the Maryland Institute College of Art as \"the most famous photograph in the world\".", "img_list": ["Q5809_0.jpg", "Q5809_1.jpg", "Q5809_2.jpg", "Q5809_3.jpg", "Q5809_4.jpg", "Q5809_5.svg", "Q5809_6.jpg", "Q5809_7.jpg", "Q5809_8.jpg", "Q5809_9.jpg", "Q5809_10.jpg", "Q5809_11.jpg", "Q5809_12.png", "Q5809_13.jpg", "Q5809_14.jpg", "Q5809_15.jpg", "Q5809_16.jpg", "Q5809_17.svg", "Q5809_18.jpg", "Q5809_19.jpg", "Q5809_20.jpg", "Q5809_21.jpg", "Q5809_22.jpg", "Q5809_23.JPG", "Q5809_24.svg", "Q5809_25.svg", "Q5809_26.svg", "Q5809_27.jpg", "Q5809_28.jpg", "Q5809_29.jpg", "Q5809_30.jpg", "Q5809_31.svg", "Q5809_32.jpg", "Q5809_33.jpg", "Q5809_34.svg", "Q5809_35.svg", "Q5809_36.jpg", "Q5809_37.svg", "Q5809_38.png", "Q5809_39.jpg", "Q5809_40.svg", "Q5809_41.svg", "Q5809_42.jpg", "Q5809_43.png", "Q5809_44.svg", "Q5809_45.jpg"], "summary": "Che Guevara:Sex: male.

Ideologically a Marxist\u2013Leninist, his theories, military strategies, and political policies are collectively known as Maoism.\nMao was the son of a prosperous peasant in Shaoshan, Hunan. He supported Chinese nationalism and had an anti-imperialist outlook early in his life, and was particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. He later adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at Peking University as a librarian and became a founding member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CCP, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies, and ultimately became head of the CCP during the Long March. Although the CCP temporarily allied with the KMT under the Second United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), China's civil war resumed after Japan's surrender, and Mao's forces defeated the Nationalist government, which withdrew to Taiwan in 1949.\nOn October 1, 1949, Mao proclaimed the foundation of the PRC, a Marxist\u2013Leninist single-party state controlled by the CCP. In the following years he solidified his control through the Chinese Land Reform against landlords, the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, the \"Three-anti and Five-anti Campaigns\", and through a psychological victory in the Korean War, which altogether resulted in the deaths of several million Chinese. From 1953 to 1958, Mao played an important role in enforcing planned economy in China, constructing the first Constitution of the PRC, launching the industrialisation program, and initiating military projects such as the \"Two Bombs, One Satellite\" project and Project 523. His foreign policies during this time were dominated by the Sino-Soviet split which drove a wedge between China and the Soviet Union. In 1955, Mao launched the Sufan movement, and in 1957 he launched the Anti-Rightist Campaign, in which at least 550,000 people, mostly intellectuals and dissidents, were persecuted. In 1958, he launched the Great Leap Forward that aimed to rapidly transform China's economy from agrarian to industrial, which led to the deadliest famine in history and the deaths of 15\u201355 million people between 1958 and 1962. In 1963, Mao launched the Socialist Education Movement, and in 1966 he initiated the Cultural Revolution, a program to remove \"counter-revolutionary\" elements in Chinese society which lasted 10 years and was marked by violent class struggle, widespread destruction of cultural artifacts, and an unprecedented elevation of Mao's cult of personality. Tens of millions of people were persecuted during the Revolution, while the estimated number of deaths ranges from hundreds of thousands to millions. After years of ill health, Mao suffered a series of heart attacks in 1976 and died at the age of 82. During Mao's era, China's population grew from around 550 million to over 900 million while the government did not strictly enforce its family planning policy.\nA controversial figure within and outside China, Mao is still regarded as one of the most important individuals in the twentieth century. Beyond politics, Mao is also known as a theorist, military strategist, and poet. During the Mao era, China was heavily involved with other southeast Asian communist conflicts such as the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cambodian Civil War, which brought the Khmer Rouge to power. He ruled China through an autocratic and totalitarian regime responsible for mass repression as well as destruction of religious and cultural artifacts and sites. The government was responsible for vast numbers of deaths with estimates ranging from 40 to 80 million victims through starvation, persecution, prison labour, and mass executions. Mao has been praised with transforming China from a semi-colony to a leading world power, with greatly advanced literacy, women's rights, basic healthcare, primary education and life expectancy.", "img_list": ["Q5816_0.jpg", "Q5816_1.jpg", "Q5816_2.jpg", "Q5816_3.jpg", "Q5816_4.jpg", "Q5816_5.jpg", "Q5816_6.jpg", "Q5816_8.svg", "Q5816_9.svg", "Q5816_10.svg", "Q5816_11.svg", "Q5816_12.svg", "Q5816_13.svg", "Q5816_14.svg", "Q5816_15.svg", "Q5816_16.svg", "Q5816_17.svg", "Q5816_18.jpg", "Q5816_19.jpg", "Q5816_20.jpg", "Q5816_21.jpg", "Q5816_22.jpg", "Q5816_23.svg", "Q5816_24.jpeg", "Q5816_25.jpg", "Q5816_26.jpg", "Q5816_27.jpg", "Q5816_28.jpg", "Q5816_29.jpg", "Q5816_30.JPG", "Q5816_31.jpg", "Q5816_32.jpg", "Q5816_33.jpg", "Q5816_34.jpg", "Q5816_35.jpg", "Q5816_36.svg", "Q5816_37.jpg", "Q5816_38.svg", "Q5816_39.jpg", "Q5816_40.jpg", "Q5816_41.jpg", "Q5816_42.jpg", "Q5816_43.jpg", "Q5816_44.svg", "Q5816_45.svg", "Q5816_46.svg", "Q5816_47.jpg", "Q5816_48.jpg", "Q5816_49.svg", "Q5816_50.jpg", "Q5816_51.svg", "Q5816_52.png", "Q5816_53.jpg", "Q5816_54.svg", "Q5816_55.jpg", "Q5816_56.JPG", "Q5816_57.svg", "Q5816_58.svg", "Q5816_59.svg", "Q5816_60.svg", "Q5816_61.ogg", "Q5816_62.svg"], "summary": "Mao Zedong:Sex: male.

His works include plays, poetry, literature, and aesthetic criticism as well as treatises on botany, anatomy, and colour. He is considered to be the greatest German literary figure of the modern era.Goethe took up residence in Weimar in November 1775 following the success of his first novel, The Sorrows of Young Werther (1774). He was ennobled by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Karl August, in 1782. He was an early participant in the Sturm und Drang literary movement. During his first ten years in Weimar, Goethe became a member of the Duke's privy council, sat on the war and highway commissions, oversaw the reopening of silver mines in nearby Ilmenau, and implemented a series of administrative reforms at the University of Jena. He also contributed to the planning of Weimar's botanical park and the rebuilding of its Ducal Palace.Goethe's first major scientific work, the Metamorphosis of Plants, was published after he returned from a 1788 tour of Italy. In 1791 he was made managing director of the theatre at Weimar, and in 1794 he began a friendship with the dramatist, historian, and philosopher Friedrich Schiller, whose plays he premiered until Schiller's death in 1805. During this period Goethe published his second novel, Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship; the verse epic Hermann and Dorothea, and, in 1808, the first part of his most celebrated drama, Faust. His conversations and various shared undertakings throughout the 1790s with Schiller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Johann Gottfried Herder, Alexander von Humboldt, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and August and Friedrich Schlegel have come to be collectively termed Weimar Classicism.\nThe German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer named Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship one of the four greatest novels ever written, while the American philosopher and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson selected Goethe as one of six \"representative men\" in his work of the same name (along with Plato, Emanuel Swedenborg, Montaigne, Napoleon, and Shakespeare). Goethe's comments and observations form the basis of several biographical works, notably Johann Peter Eckermann's Conversations with Goethe (1836).

The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century music, he is often referred to by the honorific nicknames \"Godfather of Soul\", \"Mr. Dynamite\", and \"Soul Brother No. 1\". In a career that lasted over 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction in New York on January 23, 1986.\nBrown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He first came to national public attention in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads \"Please, Please, Please\" and \"Try Me\", Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\", \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" and \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\".\nDuring the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly \"Africanized\" approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" and \"The Payback\". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.\nBrown recorded 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the Billboard R&B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was inducted into the first class of the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame, and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the Billboard R&B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in The Top 500 Artists. He is ranked seventh on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.", "img_list": ["Q5950_0.jpg", "Q5950_1.jpg", "Q5950_2.jpg", "Q5950_3.jpg", "Q5950_4.jpg", "Q5950_5.jpg", "Q5950_6.JPG", "Q5950_7.jpg", "Q5950_8.jpg", "Q5950_9.jpg", "Q5950_10.jpg", "Q5950_11.jpg", "Q5950_12.svg"], "summary": "James Brown:Sex: male.

He spent the bulk of his career with two teams: nine seasons with the Orix BlueWave of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan, where he began his career, and 14 with the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States. After playing the first 12 years of his MLB career for the Mariners, Suzuki played two and a half seasons with the New York Yankees before signing with the Miami Marlins. He played three seasons with the Marlins before returning to the Mariners in 2018.\nSuzuki established a number of batting records, including MLB's single-season record for hits with 262. He achieved 10 consecutive 200-hit seasons, the longest streak by any player in history. Between his major league career in both Japan and the United States, Suzuki has the most hits by any player in top-tier professional leagues. He also has recorded the most hits of all Japanese-born players in MLB history.\nIn his combined playing time in the NPB and MLB, Suzuki received 17 consecutive selections both as an All-Star and Gold Glove winner, won nine league batting titles, and was named most valuable player (MVP) four times. In the NPB, he won seven consecutive batting titles and three consecutive Pacific League MVP Awards. In 2001, Suzuki became the first Japanese-born position player to be posted and signed to an MLB club. He led the American League (AL) in batting average and stolen bases en route to being named AL Rookie of the Year and AL MVP.\nSuzuki was the first MLB player to enter the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame (The Golden Players Club). He was a ten-time MLB All-Star and won the 2007 All-Star Game MVP Award for a three-hit performance that included the event's first-ever inside-the-park home run.

He later began pursuing a musical career and in 2000 he produced Power of the Dollar for Columbia Records, but days before the planned release he was shot and the album was never released. In 2002, after 50 Cent released the compilation album Guess Who's Back?, he was discovered by Eminem and signed to Shady Records, under the aegis of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records.\nWith the aid of Eminem and Dr. Dre (who produced his first major-label album Get Rich or Die Tryin'), 50 Cent became one of the world's best selling rappers and rose to prominence as de facto leader of East Coast hip hop group G-Unit. In 2003, he founded G-Unit Records, signing his G-Unit associates Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. 50 Cent had similar commercial and critical success with his second album, The Massacre, which was released in 2005. He underwent musical changes by his fifth album, Animal Ambition (2014), and is currently working on his sixth studio album. He executive-produced and starred in the television series Power (2014\u20132020) and is slated to produce its spin-offs.50 Cent has sold over 30 million albums worldwide and won several awards, including a Grammy Award, thirteen Billboard Music Awards, six World Music Awards, three American Music Awards and four BET Awards.

He is the founder and CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics, and previously co-founded, co-owned, and was the president of Death Row Records. Dr. Dre began his career as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1985 and later found fame with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. The group popularized explicit lyrics in hip hop to detail the violence of street life. During the early 1990s, Dre was credited as a key figure in the crafting and popularization of West Coast G-funk, a subgenre of hip hop characterized by a synthesizer foundation and slow, heavy beats.\nDre's solo debut studio album The Chronic (1992), released under Death Row Records, made him one of the best-selling American music artists of 1993. It earned him a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for the single \"Let Me Ride\", as well as several accolades for the single \"Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang\". That year, he produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Doggy Dogg's debut album Doggystyle and mentored producers such as his stepbrother Warren G (leading to the multi-platinum debut Regulate...G Funk Era in 1994) and Snoop Dogg's cousin Daz Dillinger (leading to the double-platinum debut Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound in 1995), as well as mentor to upcoming producers Sam Sneed and Mel-Man. In 1996, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, in 1996, and released a solo album, 2001, in 1999.\nDuring the 2000s, Dre focused on producing other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. He signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2002, and co-produced their albums. He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many other rappers, including 2Pac, the D.O.C., Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Knoc-turn'al, the Game, Kendrick Lamar, and Anderson .Paak. Dre has also had acting roles in movies such as Set It Off, The Wash and Training Day. He has won six Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. Rolling Stone ranked him number 56 on the list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He was the second-richest figure in hip hop as of 2018 with an estimated net worth of $800 million.\nAccusations of Dre's violence against women have been widely publicized. Following his assault of television host Dee Barnes, he was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement. A civil suit was settled out of court. In 2015, Michel'le, the mother of one of his children, accused him of domestic violence during their time together as a couple. Their abusive relationship is portrayed in her 2016 biopic Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge & Michel'le. Lisa Johnson, the mother of three of Dr. Dre's children, stated that he beat her many times, including while she was pregnant. She was granted a restraining order against him. Former labelmate Tairrie B claimed that Dre assaulted her at a party in 1990, in response to her track \"Ruthless Bitch\". Two weeks following the release of his third album, Compton in August 2015, he issued an apology to the women \"I've hurt\".\n\n", "img_list": ["Q6078_0.svg", "Q6078_1.PNG", "Q6078_2.png", "Q6078_3.jpg", "Q6078_4.jpg", "Q6078_5.jpg", "Q6078_6.jpg", "Q6078_7.png", "Q6078_8.png", "Q6078_9.svg", "Q6078_10.jpg", "Q6078_11.jpg", "Q6078_12.jpg", "Q6078_13.svg"], "summary": "Dr. Dre:Sex: male.

Bloomberg is considered to have had far-reaching influence on the politics, business sector, and culture of New York City during his three terms as mayor. He has also faced significant criticism for his expansion of the city's stop and frisk program, support for which he reversed with an apology before his 2020 presidential run.After a brief stint as a full-time philanthropist, he re-assumed the position of CEO at Bloomberg L.P. by the end of 2014.

Considered one of the most influential rappers of all time, Shakur is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Much of Shakur's music has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered a symbol of activism against inequality.\nShakur was born in New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album 2Pacalypse Now in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip hop for his conscious rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his follow-up albums Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z... (1993) and Me Against the World (1995). His Diamond certified album All Eyez on Me (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. In addition to his music career, Shakur also found considerable success as an actor, with his starring roles in Juice (1992), Poetic Justice (1993), Above the Rim (1994), Bullet (1996), Gridlock'd (1997), and Gang Related (1997).\nDuring the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration. In 1995, Shakur served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending an appeal of his conviction. Following his release, he signed to Marion \"Suge\" Knight's label Death Row Records and became heavily involved in the growing East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas; he died six days later. Following his murder, Shakur's friend-turned-rival, the Notorious B.I.G., was at first considered a suspect due to their public feud, but was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997 while visiting Los Angeles.Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death, all of which have been certified Platinum in the United States. In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.

Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa Am\u00e9rica (17). He also holds the record for most international goals by a South American male (80). Messi has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.\nBorn and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain to join Barcelona at age 13, for whom he made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008\u201309 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times and in a row. During the 2011\u201312 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the 2014\u201315 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.\nAn Argentine international, Messi is both his country's highest appearance-maker and their all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot Diego Maradona, who described Messi as his successor. After his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup in 2006, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 FIFA World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica, winning the Golden Ball in the 2015 edition. After announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a third-place finish at the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica, and won the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, while winning the Golden Ball and Golden Boot award for the latter. This achievement would see him receive a record seventh Ballon d'Or in 2021.\nMessi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. In February 2020, he was awarded the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year, thus becoming the first footballer and the first team sport athlete to win the award. Later that year, Messi became the second footballer (and second team-sport athlete) to surpass $1 billion in career earnings.", "img_list": ["Q615_0.jpg", "Q615_1.jpg", "Q615_2.svg", "Q615_3.svg", "Q615_4.jpg", "Q615_5.jpg", "Q615_6.jpg", "Q615_7.jpg", "Q615_8.jpg", "Q615_9.svg", "Q615_10.svg", "Q615_11.svg", "Q615_12.svg", "Q615_13.svg", "Q615_14.svg", "Q615_15.svg", "Q615_16.svg", "Q615_17.svg", "Q615_18.svg", "Q615_19.svg", "Q615_20.svg", "Q615_21.svg", "Q615_22.svg", "Q615_23.svg", "Q615_24.svg", "Q615_25.svg", "Q615_26.svg", "Q615_27.svg", "Q615_28.svg", "Q615_29.svg", "Q615_30.svg", "Q615_31.svg", "Q615_32.svg", "Q615_33.svg", "Q615_34.svg", "Q615_35.svg", "Q615_36.svg", "Q615_37.svg", "Q615_38.svg", "Q615_39.svg", "Q615_40.svg", "Q615_41.svg", "Q615_42.svg", "Q615_43.svg", "Q615_44.svg", "Q615_45.svg", "Q615_46.svg", "Q615_47.svg", "Q615_48.svg", "Q615_49.svg", "Q615_50.svg", "Q615_51.svg", "Q615_52.svg", "Q615_53.svg", "Q615_54.svg", "Q615_55.svg", "Q615_56.jpg", "Q615_57.svg", "Q615_58.jpg", "Q615_59.jpg", "Q615_60.PNG", "Q615_61.jpg", "Q615_62.jpg", "Q615_63.jpg", "Q615_64.ogg", "Q615_65.png", "Q615_66.jpg", "Q615_67.jpg", "Q615_68.jpg", "Q615_69.jpg", "Q615_70.jpg", "Q615_71.jpg", "Q615_72.jpg", "Q615_73.svg", "Q615_74.jpg", "Q615_75.jpg", "Q615_76.jpg", "Q615_77.jpg", "Q615_78.jpg", "Q615_79.jpg", "Q615_80.jpg", "Q615_81.jpg", "Q615_82.jpg", "Q615_83.jpg", "Q615_84.jpg", "Q615_85.svg", "Q615_86.jpg", "Q615_87.svg", "Q615_88.svg", "Q615_89.svg", "Q615_99.svg"], "summary": "Lionel Messi:Sex: male.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 47th vice president from 2009 to 2017 under Barack Obama and represented Delaware in the United States Senate from 1973 to 2009.\nBiden was born and raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania, moving with his family to New Castle County, Delaware in 1953 when he was ten. He studied at the University of Delaware before earning his law degree from Syracuse University in 1968. He was elected to the New Castle County Council in 1970 and became the sixth-youngest senator in U.S. history after he was elected to the United States Senate from Delaware in 1972, at age 29. Biden was the chair or ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for 12 years and was influential in foreign affairs during Obama's presidency. He also chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1987 to 1995, dealing with drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties issues; led the effort to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the Violence Against Women Act; and oversaw six U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including the contentious hearings for Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas. He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988 and 2008. Biden was reelected to the Senate six times and was the fourth-most senior sitting senator at the time when he became Obama's vice president after they won the 2008 presidential election, defeating John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin. Obama and Biden were reelected in 2012, defeating Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan.\nDuring eight years as vice president, Biden leaned on his Senate experience and frequently represented the administration in negotiations with congressional Republicans, including on the Budget Control Act of 2011, which resolved a debt ceiling crisis, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which addressed the impending \"fiscal cliff\". He also oversaw infrastructure spending in 2009 to counteract the Great Recession. On foreign policy, Biden was a close counselor to the president and took a leading role in designing the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011. In 2017, Obama awarded Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction.\nBiden and his running mate Kamala Harris defeated incumbent president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence in the 2020 presidential election. Biden is the oldest president, the first to have a female vice president, the first from Delaware, and the second Catholic after John F. Kennedy. His early presidential activity centered around proposing, lobbying for, and signing into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to help the United States recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing recession, as well as a series of executive orders. Biden's orders addressed the pandemic and reversed several Trump administration policies, including rejoining the Paris Agreement on climate change and accepting new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, although a federal judge blocked the latter. Biden completed the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by September 2021; during this, the Afghan government fell and the Taliban seized control, causing Biden to face criticism over the manner of withdrawal, with allegations of poor planning. Biden proposed the Build Back Better Plan, aspects of which were incorporated into the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which Biden signed into law in November 2021.", "img_list": ["Q6279_0.jpg", "Q6279_1.jpg", "Q6279_2.svg", "Q6279_3.jpg", "Q6279_4.jpg", "Q6279_5.jpg", "Q6279_6.jpg", "Q6279_7.jpg", "Q6279_8.svg", "Q6279_9.svg", "Q6279_10.svg", "Q6279_11.svg", "Q6279_12.svg", "Q6279_13.svg", "Q6279_14.svg", "Q6279_15.svg", "Q6279_16.svg", "Q6279_17.svg", "Q6279_18.svg", "Q6279_19.svg", "Q6279_20.svg", "Q6279_21.svg", "Q6279_22.svg", "Q6279_23.svg", "Q6279_24.svg", "Q6279_25.svg", "Q6279_26.svg", "Q6279_27.svg", "Q6279_28.svg", "Q6279_29.svg", "Q6279_30.svg", "Q6279_31.svg", "Q6279_32.svg", "Q6279_33.svg", "Q6279_34.svg", "Q6279_35.svg", "Q6279_36.svg", "Q6279_37.svg", "Q6279_38.svg", "Q6279_39.svg", "Q6279_40.svg", "Q6279_41.svg", "Q6279_42.svg", "Q6279_43.svg", "Q6279_44.svg", "Q6279_45.svg", "Q6279_46.svg", "Q6279_47.svg", "Q6279_48.svg", "Q6279_49.svg", "Q6279_50.svg", "Q6279_51.svg", "Q6279_52.svg", "Q6279_53.svg", "Q6279_54.svg", "Q6279_55.svg", "Q6279_56.svg", "Q6279_57.svg", "Q6279_58.svg", "Q6279_59.svg", "Q6279_60.svg", "Q6279_61.svg", "Q6279_62.svg", "Q6279_63.svg", "Q6279_64.svg", "Q6279_65.svg", "Q6279_66.svg", "Q6279_67.svg", "Q6279_68.svg", "Q6279_69.svg", "Q6279_70.svg", "Q6279_71.svg", "Q6279_72.svg", "Q6279_73.svg", "Q6279_74.svg", "Q6279_75.svg", "Q6279_76.svg", "Q6279_77.svg", "Q6279_78.svg", "Q6279_79.svg", "Q6279_80.svg", "Q6279_81.svg", "Q6279_82.svg", "Q6279_83.svg", "Q6279_84.svg", "Q6279_85.svg", "Q6279_86.svg", "Q6279_87.svg", "Q6279_88.svg", "Q6279_89.svg", "Q6279_90.svg", "Q6279_91.svg", "Q6279_92.svg", "Q6279_93.svg", "Q6279_94.svg", "Q6279_95.svg", "Q6279_96.svg", "Q6279_97.svg", "Q6279_98.svg", "Q6279_99.svg", "Q6279_100.svg", "Q6279_101.svg", "Q6279_102.svg", "Q6279_103.svg", "Q6279_104.svg", "Q6279_105.svg", "Q6279_106.svg", "Q6279_107.svg", "Q6279_108.svg", "Q6279_109.svg", "Q6279_110.svg", "Q6279_111.svg", "Q6279_112.svg", "Q6279_113.svg", "Q6279_114.svg", "Q6279_115.svg", "Q6279_116.svg", "Q6279_117.svg", "Q6279_118.svg", "Q6279_119.svg", "Q6279_120.svg", "Q6279_121.svg", "Q6279_122.svg", "Q6279_123.svg", "Q6279_124.svg", "Q6279_125.svg", "Q6279_126.svg", "Q6279_127.svg", "Q6279_128.svg", "Q6279_129.svg", "Q6279_130.svg", "Q6279_131.svg", "Q6279_132.svg", "Q6279_133.svg", "Q6279_134.svg", "Q6279_135.svg", "Q6279_136.svg", "Q6279_137.svg", "Q6279_138.svg", "Q6279_139.svg", "Q6279_140.svg", "Q6279_141.svg", "Q6279_142.svg", "Q6279_143.svg", "Q6279_144.svg", "Q6279_145.svg", "Q6279_146.svg", "Q6279_147.svg", "Q6279_148.svg", "Q6279_149.svg", "Q6279_150.svg", "Q6279_151.svg", "Q6279_152.svg", "Q6279_153.svg", "Q6279_154.svg", "Q6279_155.svg", "Q6279_156.svg", "Q6279_157.svg", "Q6279_158.svg", "Q6279_159.svg", "Q6279_160.svg", "Q6279_161.svg", "Q6279_162.svg", "Q6279_163.svg", "Q6279_164.svg", "Q6279_165.svg", "Q6279_166.svg", "Q6279_167.jpg", "Q6279_168.svg", "Q6279_169.jpg", "Q6279_170.jpg", "Q6279_171.jpg", "Q6279_172.png", "Q6279_173.jpg", "Q6279_174.jpg", "Q6279_175.jpg", "Q6279_176.jpg", "Q6279_177.jpg", "Q6279_178.jpg", "Q6279_179.svg", "Q6279_180.jpg", "Q6279_181.jpg", "Q6279_182.jpg", "Q6279_183.jpg", "Q6279_184.jpg", "Q6279_185.png", "Q6279_186.jpg", "Q6279_187.jpg", "Q6279_188.jpg", "Q6279_189.jpg", "Q6279_190.svg", "Q6279_191.svg", "Q6279_192.svg", "Q6279_193.svg", "Q6279_194.jpg", "Q6279_195.svg", "Q6279_196.svg", "Q6279_197.jpg", "Q6279_198.jpg", "Q6279_199.svg", "Q6279_200.svg", "Q6279_201.svg", "Q6279_202.svg", "Q6279_203.svg", "Q6279_208.svg", "Q6279_210.svg", "Q6279_215.svg", "Q6279_218.svg", "Q6279_219.svg", "Q6279_220.svg", "Q6279_222.svg", "Q6279_223.svg", "Q6279_224.svg", "Q6279_227.jpg", "Q6279_229.jpg"], "summary": "Joe Biden:Sex: male.

A member of the Democratic Party, she was the party's nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election, becoming the first woman to win a presidential nomination by a major U.S. political party. Clinton won the popular vote in the election, making her the first woman to do so. However, she lost  the Electoral College.\nRaised in the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge, Rodham graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married future president Bill Clinton in 1975; the two had met at Yale. In 1977, Clinton co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal Services Corporation in 1978 and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following year. The National Law Journal twice listed her as one of the hundred most influential lawyers in America. Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. As the first lady of the United States, Clinton advocated for healthcare reform. In 1994, her major initiative\u2014the Clinton health care plan\u2014failed to gain approval from Congress. In 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a leading role in advocating the creation of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Adoption and Safe Families Act, and the Foster Care Independence Act. Clinton advocated for gender equality at the 1995 UN conference on women. Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led her to issue a statement that reaffirmed her commitment to the marriage.\nIn 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female senator from New York and became the first First lady to simultaneously hold elected office, and then the first former First lady to serve in the Senate. She was re-elected in 2006 and chaired the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee from 2003 to 2007. During her Senate tenure, Clinton advocated for medical benefits for first responders whose health was damaged in the September 11 attacks. She supported the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002 but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. In 2008, Clinton ran for president but was defeated by eventual winner Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries. Clinton was U.S. secretary of state in the first term of the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. During her tenure, Clinton established the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. She responded to the Arab Spring by advocating military intervention in Libya but was harshly criticized by Republicans for the failure to prevent or adequately respond to the 2012 Benghazi attack. Clinton helped to organize a diplomatic isolation and a regime of international sanctions against Iran in an effort to force it to curtail its nuclear program; this effort eventually led to the multinational JCPOA nuclear agreement in 2015. Her use of a private email server when she was Secretary of State was the subject of intense scrutiny; while no charges were filed against Clinton, the email controversy was the single most covered topic during the 2016 presidential election.\nClinton made a second presidential run in 2016. After winning the Democratic nomination, she ran in the general election with Virginia senator Tim Kaine as her running mate. Clinton lost the presidential election to Republican opponent Donald Trump in the Electoral College despite winning a plurality of the popular vote. Following her loss, she wrote her third memoir, What Happened, and launched Onward Together, a political action organization dedicated to fundraising for progressive political groups. Since January 2020, she has been the chancellor of Queen's University Belfast in Belfast, Northern Ireland.", "img_list": ["Q6294_0.jpg", "Q6294_1.svg", "Q6294_2.svg", "Q6294_3.jpg", "Q6294_4.jpg", "Q6294_5.jpg", "Q6294_6.jpg", "Q6294_7.jpg", "Q6294_8.jpg", "Q6294_9.svg", "Q6294_10.jpg", "Q6294_12.svg", "Q6294_13.svg", "Q6294_14.jpg", "Q6294_15.jpg", "Q6294_16.jpg", "Q6294_17.jpg", "Q6294_18.jpg", "Q6294_19.jpg", "Q6294_20.jpg", "Q6294_21.jpg", "Q6294_22.jpg", "Q6294_23.jpg", "Q6294_24.jpg", "Q6294_25.jpg", "Q6294_26.jpg", "Q6294_27.jpg", "Q6294_28.jpg", "Q6294_29.jpg", "Q6294_30.jpg", "Q6294_31.jpg", "Q6294_32.jpg", "Q6294_33.jpg", "Q6294_34.svg", "Q6294_35.svg", "Q6294_36.jpg", "Q6294_37.jpg", "Q6294_38.svg", "Q6294_39.jpg", "Q6294_40.jpg", "Q6294_41.jpg", "Q6294_42.jpg", "Q6294_43.jpg", "Q6294_44.jpg", "Q6294_45.svg", "Q6294_46.svg", "Q6294_47.svg", "Q6294_48.jpg", "Q6294_49.jpg", "Q6294_50.jpg", "Q6294_51.svg", "Q6294_52.jpg", "Q6294_53.svg", "Q6294_54.svg", "Q6294_55.svg", "Q6294_56.svg", "Q6294_62.jpg"], "summary": "Hillary Clinton:Sex: female.

After embarking on a music career in Winnipeg in the 1960s, Young moved to Los Angeles, joining Buffalo Springfield with Stephen Stills, Richie Furay and others. Since the beginning of his solo career with his backing band Crazy Horse, Young has released many critically acclaimed and important albums, such as Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, After the Gold Rush,  Harvest and Rust Never Sleeps. He was a part-time member of Crosby, Stills & Nash.\nYoung has received several Grammy and Juno Awards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted him twice: in 1995 as a solo artist and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield. In 2000, Rolling Stone named Young  No. 34 on their list of the 100 greatest musical artists. According to Acclaimed Music, he is the seventh most celebrated artist in popular music history. His guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature high tenor singing voice define his long career. He also plays piano and harmonica on many albums, which frequently combine folk, rock, country and other musical genres. His often distorted electric guitar playing, especially with Crazy Horse, earned him the nickname \"Godfather of Grunge\" and led to his 1995 album Mirror Ball with Pearl Jam. More recently he has been backed by Promise of the Real. 21 of his albums and singles have been certified Gold and Platinum in U.S by RIAA certification.Young directed (or co-directed) films using the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\", including Journey Through the Past (1973), Rust Never Sleeps (1979), Human Highway (1982), Greendale (2003), and CSNY/D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (2008).

A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, she was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I Soter, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great. After the death of Cleopatra, Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire, marking the end of the second to last Hellenistic state and the age that had lasted since the reign of Alexander (336\u2013323 BC). Her native language was Koine Greek, and she was the only Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language.In 58 BC, Cleopatra presumably accompanied her father, Ptolemy XII Auletes, during his exile to Rome after a revolt in Egypt (a Roman client state) allowed his rival daughter Berenice IV to claim his throne. Berenice was killed in 55 BC when Ptolemy returned to Egypt with Roman military assistance. When he died in 51 BC, the joint reign of Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIII began, but a falling-out between them led to open civil war. After losing the 48 BC Battle of Pharsalus in Greece against his rival Julius Caesar (a Roman dictator and consul) in Caesar's Civil War, the Roman statesman Pompey fled to Egypt. Pompey had been a political ally of Ptolemy XII, but Ptolemy XIII, at the urging of his court eunuchs, had Pompey ambushed and killed before Caesar arrived and occupied Alexandria. Caesar then attempted to reconcile the rival Ptolemaic siblings, but Ptolemy's chief adviser, Potheinos, viewed Caesar's terms as favoring Cleopatra, so his forces besieged her and Caesar at the palace. Shortly after the siege was lifted by reinforcements, Ptolemy XIII died in the 47 BC Battle of the Nile; Cleopatra's half-sister Arsinoe IV was eventually exiled to Ephesus for her role in carrying out the siege. Caesar declared Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy XIV joint rulers but maintained a private affair with Cleopatra that produced a son, Caesarion. Cleopatra traveled to Rome as a client queen in 46 and 44 BC, where she stayed at Caesar's villa. After the assassinations of Caesar and (on her orders) Ptolemy XIV in 44 BC, she named Caesarion co-ruler as Ptolemy XV.\nIn the Liberators' civil war of 43\u201342 BC, Cleopatra sided with the Roman Second Triumvirate formed by Caesar's grandnephew and heir Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children Alexander Helios, Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event, their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister Octavia Minor led to the Final War of the Roman Republic. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda, forced Antony's allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his Roman triumphal procession, she killed herself by poisoning, contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp.\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Roman historiography and Latin poetry produced a generally critical view of the queen that pervaded later Medieval and Renaissance literature. In the visual arts, her ancient depictions include Roman busts, paintings, and sculptures, cameo carvings and glass, Ptolemaic and Roman coinage, and reliefs. In Renaissance and Baroque art, she was the subject of many works including operas, paintings, poetry, sculptures, and theatrical dramas. She has become a pop culture icon of Egyptomania since the Victorian era, and in modern times, Cleopatra has appeared in the applied and fine arts, burlesque satire, Hollywood films, and brand images for commercial products.", "img_list": ["Q635_0.JPG", "Q635_1.jpg", "Q635_2.jpg", "Q635_3.jpg", "Q635_4.jpg", "Q635_5.jpg", "Q635_6.JPG", "Q635_7.jpg", "Q635_8.jpg", "Q635_9.jpg", "Q635_10.JPG", "Q635_11.jpg", "Q635_12.jpg", "Q635_13.jpg", "Q635_14.jpg", "Q635_15.jpg", "Q635_16.jpg", "Q635_17.jpg", "Q635_18.jpg", "Q635_19.jpg", "Q635_20.jpg", "Q635_21.jpg", "Q635_22.jpg", "Q635_23.jpg", "Q635_24.jpg", "Q635_25.jpg", "Q635_26.svg", "Q635_27.JPG", "Q635_28.jpg", "Q635_29.jpg", "Q635_30.jpg", "Q635_31.jpg", "Q635_32.svg", "Q635_33.svg", "Q635_34.JPG", "Q635_35.jpg", "Q635_36.jpg", "Q635_37.JPG", "Q635_38.jpg", "Q635_39.jpg", "Q635_40.jpg", "Q635_41.jpg", "Q635_42.jpg", "Q635_43.svg", "Q635_44.jpg", "Q635_45.jpg", "Q635_46.jpg", "Q635_47.jpg", "Q635_48.jpg", "Q635_49.jpg", "Q635_50.png", "Q635_51.jpg", "Q635_52.jpg", "Q635_53.svg", "Q635_54.jpg", "Q635_55.svg", "Q635_56.JPG", "Q635_57.svg", "Q635_58.jpg", "Q635_59.jpg", "Q635_60.jpg", "Q635_61.jpg", "Q635_62.jpg", "Q635_63.svg", "Q635_64.svg", "Q635_65.svg", "Q635_66.svg", "Q635_67.svg", "Q635_68.jpg", "Q635_71.jpg", "Q635_74.jpg"], "summary": "Cleopatra:Sex: female.

As a student at Columbia University in the 1940s, he began friendships with William S. Burroughs and Jack Kerouac, forming the core of the Beat Generation. He vigorously opposed militarism, economic materialism, and sexual repression, and he embodied various aspects of this counterculture with his views on drugs, sex, multiculturalism, hostility to bureaucracy, and openness to Eastern religions.Ginsberg is best known for his poem \"Howl\", in which he denounced what he saw as the destructive forces of capitalism and conformity in the United States. San Francisco police and US Customs seized \"Howl\" in 1956, and it attracted widespread publicity in 1957 when it became the subject of an obscenity trial, as it described heterosexual and homosexual sex at a time when sodomy laws made (male) homosexual acts a crime in every state. The poem reflected Ginsberg's own sexuality and his relationships with a number of men, including Peter Orlovsky, his lifelong partner. Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that \"Howl\" was not obscene, stating: \"Would there be any freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms?\"Ginsberg was a Buddhist who extensively studied Eastern religious disciplines. He lived modestly, buying his clothing in second-hand stores and residing in apartments in New York City's East Village. One of his most influential teachers was Tibetan Buddhist Ch\u00f6gyam Trungpa, the founder of the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado. At Trungpa's urging, Ginsberg and poet Anne Waldman started The Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics there in 1974.Ginsberg took part in decades of political protest against everything from the Vietnam War to the War on Drugs. His poem \"September on Jessore Road\" called attention to the plight of Bengali refugees which was caused by the 1971 Genocide and it exemplifies what literary critic Helen Vendler described as Ginsberg's persistence in protesting against \"imperial politics\" and \"persecution of the powerless\". His collection The Fall of America shared the annual National Book Award for Poetry in 1974. In 1979, he received the National Arts Club gold medal and was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 1995 for his book Cosmopolitan Greetings: Poems 1986\u20131992.", "img_list": ["Q6711_0.jpg", "Q6711_1.svg", "Q6711_2.jpg", "Q6711_3.jpg", "Q6711_4.jpg", "Q6711_5.jpg", "Q6711_6.svg", "Q6711_7.jpg", "Q6711_8.jpg", "Q6711_9.svg", "Q6711_10.svg", "Q6711_11.jpg", "Q6711_12.jpg"], "summary": "Allen Ginsberg:Sex: male.

His extant works include comedies, farces, tragicomedies, com\u00e9die-ballets, and more. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise more often than those of any other playwright today. His influence is such that the French language is often referred to as the \"language of Moli\u00e8re\".Born into a prosperous family and having studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Clermont (now Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand), Moli\u00e8re was well suited to begin a life in the theatre. Thirteen years as an itinerant actor helped him polish his comedic abilities while he began writing, combining Commedia dell'arte elements with the more refined French comedy.Through the patronage of aristocrats including Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans\u2014the brother of Louis XIV\u2014Moli\u00e8re procured a command performance before the King at the Louvre. Performing a classic play by Pierre Corneille and a farce of his own, The Doctor in Love, Moli\u00e8re was granted the use of salle du Petit-Bourbon near the Louvre, a spacious room appointed for theatrical performances. Later, he was granted the use of the theatre in the Palais-Royal. In both locations, Moli\u00e8re found success among Parisians with plays such as The Affected Ladies, The School for Husbands, and The School for Wives. This royal favour brought a royal pension to his troupe and the title Troupe du Roi (\"The King's Troupe\"). Moli\u00e8re continued as the official author of court entertainments.Despite the adulation of the court and Parisians, Moli\u00e8re's satires attracted criticism from churchmen. For Tartuffe's impiety, the Catholic Church denounced this study of religious hypocrisy, which was followed by a ban by the Parlement, while Don Juan was withdrawn and never restaged by Moli\u00e8re. His hard work in so many theatrical capacities took its toll on his health and, by 1667, he was forced to take a break from the stage. In 1673, during a production of his final play, The Imaginary Invalid, Moli\u00e8re, who suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis, was seized by a coughing fit and a haemorrhage while playing the hypochondriac Argan. He finished the performance but collapsed again and died a few hours later.", "img_list": ["Q687_0.jpg", "Q687_1.jpg", "Q687_2.JPG", "Q687_3.jpg", "Q687_4.svg", "Q687_5.jpg", "Q687_6.jpg", "Q687_7.svg", "Q687_8.svg", "Q687_9.svg", "Q687_10.jpg"], "summary": "Moli\u00e8re:Sex: male.

He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. His works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.\nMany of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".", "img_list": ["Q692_0.svg", "Q692_1.jpg", "Q692_2.png", "Q692_3.JPG", "Q692_4.jpg", "Q692_5.jpg", "Q692_6.jpg", "Q692_7.jpg", "Q692_8.JPG", "Q692_9.jpg", "Q692_10.jpg", "Q692_11.jpg", "Q692_12.jpg", "Q692_13.jpg", "Q692_14.jpg", "Q692_15.jpg", "Q692_16.jpg", "Q692_17.svg", "Q692_18.svg", "Q692_19.jpg", "Q692_20.jpg", "Q692_21.jpg", "Q692_22.jpg", "Q692_23.jpg", "Q692_24.png", "Q692_25.jpg", "Q692_26.jpg", "Q692_27.jpg", "Q692_28.png", "Q692_29.jpg", "Q692_30.jpg", "Q692_31.svg", "Q692_32.svg", "Q692_33.jpg", "Q692_34.jpg", "Q692_35.JPG", "Q692_36.jpg", "Q692_37.JPG", "Q692_38.svg", "Q692_39.svg", "Q692_40.svg", "Q692_41.jpeg", "Q692_42.jpg", "Q692_43.jpg", "Q692_44.jpg", "Q692_45.ogg", "Q692_46.svg", "Q692_47.JPG", "Q692_48.jpg", "Q692_49.jpg", "Q692_52.jpg", "Q692_53.jpg", "Q692_57.jpg", "Q692_58.jpg", "Q692_60.png"], "summary": "William Shakespeare:Sex: male.

Bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.\nBohr developed the Bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. Although the Bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. He conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. The notion of complementarity dominated Bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.\nBohr founded the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, now known as the Niels Bohr Institute, which opened in 1920. Bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including Hans Kramers, Oskar Klein, George de Hevesy, and Werner Heisenberg. He predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the Latin name for Copenhagen, where it was discovered. Later, the element bohrium was named after him.\nDuring the 1930s, Bohr helped refugees from Nazism. After Denmark was occupied by the Germans, he had a famous meeting with Heisenberg, who had become the head of the German nuclear weapon project. In September 1943 word reached Bohr that he was about to be arrested by the Germans, and he fled to Sweden. From there, he was flown to Britain, where he joined the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the British mission to the Manhattan Project. After the war, Bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. He was involved with the establishment of CERN and the Research Establishment Ris\u00f8 of the Danish Atomic Energy Commission and became the first chairman of the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1957.", "img_list": ["Q7085_0.jpg", "Q7085_1.svg", "Q7085_2.svg", "Q7085_3.svg", "Q7085_4.svg", "Q7085_5.svg", "Q7085_6.jpg", "Q7085_7.jpg", "Q7085_8.jpg", "Q7085_9.jpg", "Q7085_10.jpg", "Q7085_11.jpg", "Q7085_12.svg", "Q7085_13.jpg", "Q7085_14.jpg", "Q7085_15.svg", "Q7085_16.jpg", "Q7085_17.svg", "Q7085_18.svg", "Q7085_21.jpg", "Q7085_22.jpg", "Q7085_26.jpg"], "summary": "Niels Bohr:Sex: male.

Sometimes referred to as the Virgin Queen, Elizabeth was the last of the five monarchs of the House of Tudor.Elizabeth was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, his second wife, who was executed when Elizabeth was 21\u20442 years old. Anne's marriage to Henry VIII was annulled, and Elizabeth was declared illegitimate. Her half-brother Edward VI ruled until his death in 1553, bequeathing the crown to Lady Jane Grey and ignoring the claims of his two half-sisters, the Roman Catholic Mary and the younger Elizabeth, in spite of statute law to the contrary. Edward's will was set aside and Mary became queen, deposing Lady Jane Grey. During Mary's reign, Elizabeth was imprisoned for nearly a year on suspicion of supporting Protestant rebels.\nUpon her half-sister's death in 1558, Elizabeth succeeded to the throne and set out to rule by good counsel. She depended heavily on a group of trusted advisers, led by William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley. One of her first actions as queen was the establishment of an English Protestant church, of which she became the supreme governor. This Elizabethan Religious Settlement was to evolve into the Church of England. It was expected that Elizabeth would marry and produce an heir; however, despite numerous courtships, she never did. She was eventually succeeded by her first-cousin twice-removed, James VI of Scotland, laying the foundation for the Kingdom of Great Britain. She had earlier been reluctantly responsible for the imprisonment and execution of James's mother, Mary, Queen of Scots.\nIn government, Elizabeth was more moderate than her father and half-siblings had been. One of her mottoes was \"video et taceo\" (\"I see and keep silent\"). In religion, she was relatively tolerant and avoided systematic persecution. After the pope declared her illegitimate in 1570 and released her subjects from obedience to her, several conspiracies threatened her life, all of which were defeated with the help of her ministers' secret service. Elizabeth was cautious in foreign affairs, manoeuvring between the major powers of France and Spain. She only half-heartedly supported a number of ineffective, poorly resourced military campaigns in the Netherlands, France, and Ireland. By the mid-1580s, England could no longer avoid war with Spain.\nAs she grew older, Elizabeth became celebrated for her virginity. A cult of personality grew around her which was celebrated in the portraits, pageants, and literature of the day. Elizabeth's reign became known as the Elizabethan era. The period is famous for the flourishing of English drama, led by playwrights such as William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, and for the prowess of English maritime adventurers such as Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh. Some historians depict Elizabeth as a short-tempered, sometimes indecisive ruler, who enjoyed more than her fair share of luck. Towards the end of her reign, a series of economic and military problems weakened her popularity. However, Elizabeth is acknowledged as a charismatic performer and a dogged survivor in an era when government was ramshackle and limited, and when monarchs in neighbouring countries faced internal problems that jeopardised their thrones. After the short reigns of her half-siblings, her 44 years on the throne provided welcome stability for the kingdom and helped to forge a sense of national identity.", "img_list": ["Q7207_0.svg", "Q7207_1.jpg", "Q7207_2.jpg", "Q7207_3.svg", "Q7207_4.jpg", "Q7207_5.jpg", "Q7207_6.jpg", "Q7207_7.jpg", "Q7207_8.jpg", "Q7207_9.jpg", "Q7207_10.jpg", "Q7207_11.png", "Q7207_12.jpg", "Q7207_13.ogg", "Q7207_14.ogg", "Q7207_15.jpg", "Q7207_16.jpg", "Q7207_17.jpg", "Q7207_18.jpg", "Q7207_19.jpeg", "Q7207_20.tiff", "Q7207_21.jpg", "Q7207_22.jpg", "Q7207_23.jpg", "Q7207_24.tif", "Q7207_25.svg", "Q7207_26.jpg", "Q7207_27.jpg", "Q7207_28.svg", "Q7207_29.svg", "Q7207_30.jpg", "Q7207_31.jpg", "Q7207_32.svg", "Q7207_33.svg", "Q7207_36.jpg", "Q7207_37.jpg"], "summary": "Elizabeth I of England:Sex: female.

He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia, and, after being proclaimed the universal ruler of the Mongols, or Genghis Khan, he launched the Mongol invasions, which ultimately conquered most of Eurasia, reaching as far west as Poland and as far south as Egypt. His major campaigns include those against the Qara Khitai, Khwarezmia and the Western Xia and Jin dynasties, and his generals conducted further raids into medieval Georgia, the Kievan Rus', and Volga Bulgaria.\nGenghis Khan and his empire have a fearsome reputation in local histories. Many medieval chroniclers and modern historians describe Genghis Khan's conquests as wholesale destruction on an unprecedented scale, causing great demographic changes and a drastic decline of population as a result of mass exterminations and famine. A conservative estimate amounts to about four million civilians (whereas other figures range from forty to sixty million) who lost their lives as a consequence of Genghis Khan's military campaigns. In contrast, Buddhist Uyghurs of the kingdom of Qocho, who willingly left the Qara Khitai empire to become Mongol vassals, viewed him as a liberator. Genghis Khan was also portrayed positively by early Renaissance sources out of respect for the great spread of culture, technology and ideas under the Mongol Empire. By the end of the Great Khan's life, the Mongol Empire occupied a substantial portion of Central Asia and China. Due to his exceptional military successes, Genghis Khan is often considered to be one of the greatest conquerors of all time.Beyond his military accomplishments, Genghis Khan also advanced the Mongol Empire in other ways. He decreed the adoption of the Uyghur script as the Mongol Empire's writing system.

His temple name was \"Taizu\" while his posthumous name was Emperor Gao, or Gaodi; \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the Records of the Grand Historian, is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\", which literally means \"High Founder\".\nLiu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born into a peasant family.  Prior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the Qin dynasty as a minor law enforcement officer in his home town Pei County, within the conquered state of Chu. With the First Emperor's death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his civil service position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader Xiang Yu to invade the Qin heartland and forced the surrender of the Qin ruler Ziying in 206 BC.\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the de facto chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms, and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi) with the title \"King of Han\".  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the Three Qins, starting a civil war known as the Chu\u2013Han Contention as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\nIn 202 BC, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the Battle of Gaixia, unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and corv\u00e9e, promoted Confucianism, and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu vassal states, among many other actions. He also initiated the policy of heqin to maintain a de jure peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu after losing the Battle of Baideng in 200 BCE.

Successively, she was a member of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). Born and raised in an assimilated Jewish family in Poland, she became a German citizen in 1897.\nAfter the SPD supported German involvement in World War I in 1915, Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht co-founded the anti-war Spartacus League (Spartakusbund) which eventually became the KPD. During the November Revolution, she co-founded the newspaper Die Rote Fahne (The Red Flag), the central organ of the Spartacist movement. Luxemburg considered the Spartacist uprising of January 1919 a blunder, but supported the attempted overthrow of the government and rejected any attempt at a negotiated solution. Friedrich Ebert's majority SPD government crushed the revolt and the Spartakusbund by sending in the Freikorps, government-sponsored paramilitary groups consisting mostly of World War I veterans. Freikorps troops captured and summarily executed Luxemburg and Liebknecht during the rebellion.\nDue to her pointed criticism of both the Leninist and the more moderate social democratic schools of socialism, Luxemburg has had a somewhat ambivalent reception among scholars and theorists of the political left. Nonetheless, Luxemburg and Liebknecht were extensively idolized as communist martyrs by the East German communist government. The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution asserts that idolization of Luxemburg and Liebknecht is an important tradition of the German far-left. Despite her own Polish nationality and strong ties to Polish culture, opposition from the PPS due to her stance against the creation of a bourgeois Polish state and later criticism from Stalinists have made her a controversial historical figure in Poland's present-day political discourse.", "img_list": ["Q7231_0.jpg", "Q7231_1.jpg", "Q7231_2.jpg", "Q7231_3.jpg", "Q7231_4.jpg", "Q7231_5.jpg", "Q7231_6.ogg", "Q7231_7.jpg", "Q7231_8.JPG", "Q7231_9.jpg", "Q7231_10.svg", "Q7231_11.jpg", "Q7231_12.svg", "Q7231_13.jpg", "Q7231_14.svg", "Q7231_15.jpg", "Q7231_16.jpg", "Q7231_17.jpg", "Q7231_18.jpg", "Q7231_19.jpg", "Q7231_20.jpg", "Q7231_21.jpg", "Q7231_22.JPG", "Q7231_23.svg", "Q7231_24.ogg", "Q7231_25.jpg", "Q7231_26.svg", "Q7231_27.JPG", "Q7231_28.svg", "Q7231_29.png", "Q7231_30.svg", "Q7231_31.svg", "Q7231_32.svg", "Q7231_33.jpg", "Q7231_34.jpg"], "summary": "Rosa Luxemburg:Sex: female.

He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his \"elegant prose and magical poetry\" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as \"the Bard of Bengal\". He was a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society.\nA Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bh\u0101nusi\u1e43ha (\"Sun Lion\"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in his founding of Visva-Bharati University.Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed\u2014or panned\u2014for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's \"Jana Gana Mana\" and Bangladesh's \"Amar Shonar Bangla\". The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.\n\n", "img_list": ["Q7241_0.png", "Q7241_1.jpg", "Q7241_2.svg", "Q7241_3.jpg", "Q7241_4.jpg", "Q7241_5.jpg", "Q7241_6.jpg", "Q7241_7.jpg", "Q7241_8.jpg", "Q7241_9.jpg", "Q7241_10.jpg", "Q7241_11.jpg", "Q7241_12.jpg", "Q7241_13.jpg", "Q7241_14.svg", "Q7241_15.jpg", "Q7241_16.jpg", "Q7241_17.JPG", "Q7241_18.jpg", "Q7241_19.jpg", "Q7241_20.jpg", "Q7241_21.svg", "Q7241_22.jpg", "Q7241_23.jpg", "Q7241_24.jpg", "Q7241_25.jpg", "Q7241_26.jpg", "Q7241_27.svg", "Q7241_28.ogg", "Q7241_29.jpg", "Q7241_30.jpg", "Q7241_31.jpg", "Q7241_32.jpg", "Q7241_33.jpg", "Q7241_34.jpg", "Q7241_35.JPG", "Q7241_36.jpg", "Q7241_37.jpg", "Q7241_38.svg", "Q7241_39.svg", "Q7241_40.svg", "Q7241_41.svg", "Q7241_42.jpg", "Q7241_43.jpg", "Q7241_44.jpg"], "summary": "Rabindranath Tagore:Sex: male.

He served as an emperor of the Han dynasty by restoring the dynasty in AD 25, thus founding the Eastern Han (Later Han) dynasty. He ruled over parts of China at first, and through suppression and conquest of regional warlords, the whole of China proper was consolidated by the time of his death in AD 57.\nLiu Xiu was one of the many descendants of the Han imperial family. Following the usurpation of the Han throne by Wang Mang and the ensuing civil war during the disintegration of Wang's short-lived Xin dynasty, he emerged as one of several descendants of the fallen dynasty claiming the imperial throne. After assembling forces and proclaiming himself emperor in the face of competitors, he was able to defeat his rivals, destroy the peasant army of the Chimei, known for their disorganization and marauding, and finally reunify China in AD 36.\nHe established his capital in Luoyang, 335 kilometers (208 mi) east of the former capital Chang'an, ushering in the Eastern Han (Later Han) dynasty. He implemented some reforms (notably land reform, albeit not very successfully) aimed at correcting some of the structural imbalances responsible for the downfall of the Former/Western Han.  His reforms gave a new 200-year lease of life to the Han Dynasty.\nEmperor Guangwu's campaigns featured many able generals, but curiously, he lacked major strategists.  That may very well be because he himself appeared to be a brilliant strategist; he often instructed his generals on strategy from afar, and his predictions generally would be accurate.  This was often emulated by later emperors who fancied themselves great strategists but who actually lacked Emperor Guangwu's brilliance\u2014usually to great disastrous results.\nAlso unique among emperors in Chinese history was Emperor Guangwu's combination of decisiveness and mercy. He often sought out peaceful means rather than bellicose means of putting areas under his control.

Cort\u00e9s was part of the generation of Spanish explorers and conquistadors who began the first phase of the Spanish colonization of the Americas.\nBorn in Medell\u00edn, Spain, to a family of lesser nobility, Cort\u00e9s chose to pursue adventure and riches in the New World. He went to Hispaniola and later to Cuba, where he received an encomienda (the right to the labor of certain subjects). For a short time, he served as alcalde (magistrate) of the second Spanish town founded on the island. In 1519, he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, which he partly funded. His enmity with the Governor of Cuba, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar, resulted in the recall of the expedition at the last moment, an order which Cort\u00e9s ignored.\nArriving on the continent, Cort\u00e9s executed a successful strategy of allying with some indigenous people against others. He also used a native woman, Do\u00f1a Marina, as an interpreter. She later bore his first son. When the Governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cort\u00e9s, he fought them and won, using the extra troops as reinforcements. Cort\u00e9s wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of being punished for mutiny. After he overthrew the Aztec Empire, Cort\u00e9s was awarded the title of Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de Oaxaca, while the more prestigious title of Viceroy was given to a high-ranking nobleman, Antonio de Mendoza. In 1541 Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain, where he died six years later of natural causes.\n\n", "img_list": ["Q7326_0.jpg", "Q7326_1.jpg", "Q7326_2.jpeg", "Q7326_3.jpg", "Q7326_4.jpg", "Q7326_5.svg", "Q7326_6.svg", "Q7326_7.jpg", "Q7326_8.jpg", "Q7326_9.jpg", "Q7326_10.jpg", "Q7326_11.jpg", "Q7326_12.JPG", "Q7326_13.jpg", "Q7326_14.jpg", "Q7326_15.jpg", "Q7326_16.jpg", "Q7326_17.jpg", "Q7326_18.svg", "Q7326_19.JPG", "Q7326_20.JPG", "Q7326_21.jpg", "Q7326_22.svg"], "summary": "Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s:Sex: male.

By achieving this major milestone in the Space Race he became an international celebrity, and was awarded many medals and titles, including Hero of the Soviet Union, his nation's highest honour.\nGagarin was born in the Russian village of Klushino, and in his youth was a foundryman at a steel plant in Lyubertsy. He later joined the Soviet Air Forces as a pilot and was stationed at the Luostari Air Base, near the Norwegian border, before his selection for the Soviet space programme with five other cosmonauts. Following his spaceflight, Gagarin became deputy training director of the Cosmonaut Training Centre, which was later named after him. He was also elected as a deputy of the Soviet of the Union in 1962 and then to the Soviet of Nationalities, respectively the lower and upper chambers of the Supreme Soviet.\nVostok 1 was Gagarin's only spaceflight, but he served as the backup crew to the Soyuz 1 mission, which ended in a fatal crash, killing his friend and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov.

In a career spanning six decades, he directed over 50 feature films, many of which are still widely watched and studied today. Known as the \"Master of Suspense\", he became as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo roles in most of his films, and his hosting and producing the television anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955\u201365). His films garnered 46 Academy Award nominations, including six wins, although he never won the award for Best Director despite five nominations. \nHitchcock initially trained as a technical clerk and copy writer before entering the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer. His directorial debut was the British-German silent film The Pleasure Garden (1925). His first successful film, The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, and Blackmail (1929) was the first British \"talkie\". His thrillers The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938) are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th century. By 1939, he had international recognition and producer David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of successful films followed, including Rebecca (1940), Foreign Correspondent (1940), Suspicion (1941), Shadow of a Doubt (1943), and Notorious (1946). Rebecca won the Academy Award for Best Picture, with Hitchcock nominated as Best Director; he was also nominated for Lifeboat (1944) and Spellbound (1945). After a brief commercial lull, he returned to form with Strangers on a Train (1951) and Dial M for Murder (1954); he then went on to direct four films often ranked among the greatest of all time: Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959) and Psycho (1960), the first and last of these garnering him Best Director nominations.   The Birds (1963) and  Marnie (1964) were also financially successful and are highly regarded by film historians. \nThe \"Hitchcockian\" style includes the use of camera movement to mimic a person's gaze, thereby turning viewers into voyeurs, and framing shots to maximise anxiety and fear. The film critic Robin Wood wrote that the meaning of a Hitchcock film \"is there in the method, in the progression from shot to shot. A Hitchcock film is an organism, with the whole implied in every detail and every detail related to the whole.\"  Hitchcock made multiple films with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, including four with Cary Grant in the 1940s and 50s, three with Ingrid Bergman in the last half of the 1940s, four with James Stewart over a ten-year span commencing in 1948, and three with Grace Kelly in the mid-1950s. Hitchcock became an American citizen in 1955.\nIn 2012, Hitchcock's psychological thriller Vertigo, starring Stewart, displaced Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) as the British Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world-wide poll of hundreds of film critics. As of 2021, nine of his films had been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry,  including his personal favourite, Shadow of a Doubt (1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1979 and was knighted in December that year, four months before his death on 29 April 1980.\n\n", "img_list": ["Q7374_0.jpg", "Q7374_1.ogv", "Q7374_2.svg", "Q7374_3.JPG", "Q7374_4.jpg", "Q7374_5.jpg", "Q7374_6.jpg", "Q7374_7.jpg", "Q7374_8.jpg", "Q7374_9.jpg", "Q7374_10.jpg", "Q7374_11.jpg", "Q7374_12.jpg", "Q7374_13.jpg", "Q7374_14.jpg", "Q7374_16.jpg", "Q7374_17.jpg", "Q7374_18.jpg", "Q7374_20.jpg", "Q7374_22.jpg", "Q7374_23.jpg", "Q7374_24.jpg", "Q7374_26.jpg", "Q7374_27.jpg", "Q7374_28.svg", "Q7374_29.svg", "Q7374_30.svg", "Q7374_31.svg", "Q7374_32.svg"], "summary": "Alfred Hitchcock:Sex: male.

The longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century, she was the first woman to hold that office. As prime minister, she implemented policies that became known as Thatcherism. A Soviet journalist dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\", a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style.\nThatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist, before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970\u20131974 government. In 1975, she defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition, the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom.\nOn becoming prime minister after winning the 1979 general election, Thatcher introduced a series of economic policies intended to reverse high inflation and Britain's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an oncoming recession. Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation (particularly of the financial sector), the privatisation of state-owned companies, and reducing the power and influence of trade unions. Her popularity in her first years in office waned amid recession and rising unemployment, until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support, resulting in her landslide re-election in 1983. She survived an assassination attempt by the Provisional IRA in the 1984 Brighton hotel bombing and achieved a political victory against the National Union of Mineworkers in the 1984\u201385 miners' strike.\nThatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but her subsequent support for the Community Charge (\"poll tax\") was widely unpopular, and her increasingly Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in her cabinet. She resigned as prime minister and party leader in 1990, after a challenge was launched to her leadership. After retiring from the Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher (of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire) which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel, London, at the age of 87.\nA polarising figure in British politics, Thatcher is nonetheless viewed favourably in historical rankings and public opinion of British prime ministers. Her tenure constituted a realignment towards neoliberal policies in the UK, with debate over the complicated legacy attributed to Thatcherism persisting into the 21st century.", "img_list": ["Q7416_0.jpg", "Q7416_1.svg", "Q7416_2.svg", "Q7416_3.png", "Q7416_4.svg", "Q7416_5.svg", "Q7416_6.svg", "Q7416_7.svg", "Q7416_8.svg", "Q7416_9.svg", "Q7416_10.svg", "Q7416_11.jpg", "Q7416_12.jpeg", "Q7416_13.JPG", "Q7416_14.jpg", "Q7416_15.jpg", "Q7416_16.png", "Q7416_17.jpg", "Q7416_18.jpg", "Q7416_19.jpg", "Q7416_20.jpg", "Q7416_21.jpg", "Q7416_22.jpg", "Q7416_23.jpg", "Q7416_24.jpg", "Q7416_25.jpg", "Q7416_26.jpg", "Q7416_27.gif", "Q7416_28.svg", "Q7416_29.svg", "Q7416_30.gif", "Q7416_31.png", "Q7416_32.svg", "Q7416_33.png", "Q7416_34.JPG", "Q7416_35.jpg", "Q7416_36.jpg", "Q7416_37.jpg", "Q7416_38.svg", "Q7416_39.jpg", "Q7416_40.jpg", "Q7416_41.svg", "Q7416_42.jpg", "Q7416_43.jpg", "Q7416_44.jpg", "Q7416_45.jpg", "Q7416_46.jpg", "Q7416_47.svg", "Q7416_48.svg", "Q7416_49.svg", "Q7416_50.svg", "Q7416_51.svg", "Q7416_52.svg", "Q7416_53.png"], "summary": "Margaret Thatcher:Sex: female.

He assumed the role of Emperor of China. By 1279, the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty was completed and Kublai became the first non-Han emperor to unite all of China proper.\nThe imperial portrait of Kublai was part of an album of the portraits of Yuan emperors and empresses, now in the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipei.

A member of the Democratic Party, Obama was the first African-American  president of the United States. He previously served as a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. \nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer  in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004 with his March Senate primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, a year after beginning his campaign, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama was elected over Republican nominee John McCain in the general election and was inaugurated alongside his running mate Joe Biden, on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, a decision that drew a mixture of praise and criticism.\nObama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. The main reforms include: the Affordable Care Act (ACA or \"Obamacare\"), although without a public health insurance option; the Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act served as economic stimuli amidst the Great Recession. After a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the United States\u2013Russia New START treaty, and ended military involvement in the Iraq War. In 2011, Obama ordered the drone-strike killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen and suspected al-Qaeda operative, leading to controversy. He ordered military involvement in Libya for the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi. He also ordered the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden.\nAfter winning re-election by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2013. During this term, he promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans. His administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges); same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015 after the Court ruled so in Obergefell. He advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. In foreign policy, he ordered military interventions in Iraq and Syria in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, oversaw and ultimately apologized for the deadly Kunduz hospital airstrike, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan in 2016, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after interference in the 2016 U.S. elections, brokered the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama nominated three justices to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed as justices, while Merrick Garland was denied hearings or a vote from the Republican-majority Senate. Obama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C.During Obama's terms as president, the United States' reputation abroad, as well as the American economy, significantly improved. Obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public frequently place him among the upper tier of American presidents. Since leaving office, Obama has remained active in Democratic politics, including campaigning for candidates in the 2018 midterm elections, appearing at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and campaigning for Biden during the 2020 presidential election. Outside of politics, Obama has published three bestselling books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006) and A Promised Land (2020).", "img_list": ["Q76_0.svg", "Q76_2.jpg", "Q76_3.jpg", "Q76_4.jpg", "Q76_5.jpg", "Q76_6.jpg", "Q76_7.jpg", "Q76_8.jpg", "Q76_9.svg", "Q76_10.jpg", "Q76_11.jpg", "Q76_12.jpg", "Q76_13.jpg", "Q76_14.jpg", "Q76_15.jpg", "Q76_16.svg", "Q76_17.svg", "Q76_19.svg", "Q76_20.svg", "Q76_21.jpg", "Q76_22.jpg", "Q76_23.svg", "Q76_24.jpg", "Q76_25.png", "Q76_26.svg", "Q76_27.svg", "Q76_28.jpg", "Q76_29.svg", "Q76_30.jpg", "Q76_31.jpg", "Q76_32.jpg", "Q76_33.jpg", "Q76_34.jpg", "Q76_35.jpg", "Q76_36.jpg", "Q76_37.jpg", "Q76_38.png", "Q76_39.jpg", "Q76_40.jpg", "Q76_42.svg", "Q76_43.svg", "Q76_44.svg", "Q76_45.svg", "Q76_46.png", "Q76_47.svg", "Q76_48.jpg", "Q76_49.jpg", "Q76_50.jpg", "Q76_51.svg", "Q76_52.svg", "Q76_53.svg", "Q76_54.svg", "Q76_60.jpg"], "summary": "Barack Obama:Sex: male.

A nephew of Napoleon I, he was the last monarch to rule over France. Elected to the presidency of the Second Republic in 1848, he seized power by force in 1851, when he could not constitutionally be reelected; he later proclaimed himself Emperor of the French. He founded the Second Empire, reigning until the defeat of the French Army and his capture by Prussia and its allies at the Battle of Sedan in 1870. Napoleon III was a popular monarch, who oversaw the modernisation of the French economy and filled Paris with new boulevards and parks. He expanded the French overseas empire and made the French merchant navy the second largest in the world, engaged in the Second Italian War of Independence as well as the disastrous Franco-Prussian War, in which he commanded his soldiers during the fight and was captured.\nNapoleon III commissioned a grand reconstruction of Paris carried out by the man he appointed as prefect of the Seine, Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann. He expanded and consolidated the railway system throughout the nation and modernized the banking system. Napoleon III promoted the building of the Suez Canal and established modern agriculture, which ended famines in France and made the country an agricultural exporter. He negotiated the 1860 Cobden\u2013Chevalier Free Trade Agreement with Britain and similar agreements with France's other European trading partners. Social reforms included giving French workers the right to strike and the right to organize, and the admission of the first women to French universities. \nIn foreign policy, Napoleon III aimed to reassert French influence in Europe and around the world. In Europe, he allied with Britain and defeated Russia in the Crimean War (1853\u20131856). His regime assisted Italian unification by defeating the Austrian Empire in the Franco-Austrian War and later annexed Savoy and Nice through the Treaty of Turin as its deferred reward. At the same time, his forces defended the Papal States against annexation by Italy. He was also favourable towards the 1859 union of the Danubian Principalities, which resulted in the establishment of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. Napoleon III doubled the area of the French overseas empire with expansions in Asia, the Pacific and Africa. On the other hand, the intervention in Mexico, which aimed to create a Second Mexican Empire under French protection, ended in total failure. From 1866, Napoleon III had to face the mounting power of Prussia as its Chancellor Otto von Bismarck sought German unification under Prussian leadership.

He was referred to as Citizen Louis Capet during the four months just before he was executed by guillotine. He was the son of Louis, Dauphin of France, son and heir of King Louis XV. When his father died in 1765, he became the new Dauphin. Upon his grandfather's death on 10 May 1774, he assumed the title King of France and Navarre until 4 September 1791, when he received the title of King of the French until the monarchy was abolished on 21 September 1792.\nThe first part of his reign was marked by attempts to reform the French government in accordance with Enlightenment ideas. These included efforts to abolish serfdom, remove the taille (land tax) and the corv\u00e9e (labour tax), and increase tolerance toward non-Catholics as well as abolish the death penalty for deserters. The French nobility reacted to the proposed reforms with hostility, and successfully opposed their implementation. Louis implemented deregulation of the grain market, advocated by his economic liberal minister Turgot, but it resulted in an increase in bread prices. In periods of bad harvests, it led to food scarcity which, during a particularly bad harvest in 1775, prompted the masses to revolt. From 1776, Louis XVI actively supported the North American colonists, who were seeking their independence from Great Britain, which was realised in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. The ensuing debt and financial crisis contributed to the unpopularity of the Ancien R\u00e9gime. This led to the convening of the Estates-General of 1789. Discontent among the members of France's middle and lower classes resulted in strengthened opposition to the French aristocracy and to the absolute monarchy, of which Louis and his wife Queen Marie Antoinette were viewed as representatives. Increasing tensions and violence were marked by events such as the storming of the Bastille, during which riots in Paris forced Louis to definitively recognize the legislative authority of the National Assembly.\nLouis's indecisiveness and conservatism led some elements of the people of France to view him as a symbol of the perceived tyranny of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, and his popularity deteriorated progressively. His unsuccessful flight to Varennes in June 1791, four months before the constitutional monarchy was declared, seemed to justify the rumors that the king tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign intervention. The credibility of the king was deeply undermined, and the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an ever-increasing possibility. The growth of anti-clericalism among revolutionaries resulted in the abolition of the d\u00eeme (religious land tax) and several government policies aimed at the dechristianization of France.\nIn a context of civil and international war, Louis XVI was suspended and arrested at the time of the Insurrection of 10 August 1792. One month later, the monarchy was abolished and the First French Republic was proclaimed on 21 September 1792. Louis was then tried by the National Convention (self-instituted as a tribunal for the occasion), found guilty of high treason and executed by guillotine on 21 January 1793, as a desacralized French citizen under the name of Citizen Louis Capet, in reference to Hugh Capet, the founder of the Capetian dynasty \u2013 which the revolutionaries interpreted as Louis's surname. Louis XVI was the only king of France ever to be executed, and his death brought an end to more than a thousand years of continuous French monarchy. Both of his sons died in childhood, before the Bourbon Restoration; his only child to reach adulthood, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, was given over to the Austrians in exchange for French prisoners of war, eventually dying childless in 1851.", "img_list": ["Q7732_0.png", "Q7732_1.svg", "Q7732_2.svg", "Q7732_3.svg", "Q7732_4.svg", "Q7732_5.svg", "Q7732_6.jpg", "Q7732_7.png", "Q7732_8.jpg", "Q7732_9.jpg", "Q7732_10.svg", "Q7732_11.svg", "Q7732_12.svg", "Q7732_13.svg", "Q7732_14.svg", "Q7732_15.svg", "Q7732_16.svg", "Q7732_17.jpg", "Q7732_18.jpg", "Q7732_19.svg", "Q7732_20.JPG", "Q7732_21.svg", "Q7732_22.svg", "Q7732_23.svg", "Q7732_24.jpg", "Q7732_25.jpg", "Q7732_26.jpg", "Q7732_27.jpg", "Q7732_28.gif", "Q7732_29.jpg", "Q7732_30.jpg", "Q7732_31.jpg", "Q7732_32.jpg", "Q7732_33.jpg", "Q7732_34.OGG", "Q7732_35.jpg", "Q7732_36.svg", "Q7732_37.svg", "Q7732_38.jpg", "Q7732_39.svg", "Q7732_40.svg", "Q7732_41.svg", "Q7732_42.JPG", "Q7732_43.jpg", "Q7732_47.jpg"], "summary": "Louis XVI of France:Sex: male.

His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country in history. Louis XIV's France was emblematic of the age of absolutism in Europe. The King surrounded himself with a variety of significant political, military, and cultural figures, such as Mazarin, Colbert, Louvois, the Grand Cond\u00e9, Turenne, Vauban, Boulle, Moli\u00e8re, Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, Lully, Charpentier, Marais, Le Brun, Rigaud, Bossuet, Le Vau, Mansart, Charles Perrault, Claude Perrault, and Le N\u00f4tre.\nLouis began his personal rule of France in 1661, after the death of his chief minister, the Cardinal Mazarin. An adherent of the concept of the divine right of kings, Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralised state governed from the capital. He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and, by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles, succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy, many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during his minority. By these means he became one of the most powerful French monarchs and consolidated a system of absolute monarchy in France that endured until the French Revolution. He also enforced uniformity of religion under the Gallican Catholic Church. His revocation of the Edict of Nantes abolished the rights of the Huguenot Protestant minority and subjected them to a wave of dragonnades, effectively forcing Huguenots to emigrate or convert, and virtually destroying the French Protestant community.\nDuring Louis' long reign, France emerged as the leading European power and regularly asserted its military strength. A conflict with Spain marked his entire childhood, while during his reign, the kingdom took part in three major continental conflicts, each against powerful foreign alliances: the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession. In addition, France also contested shorter wars, such as the War of Devolution and the War of the Reunions. Warfare defined Louis's foreign policy and his personality shaped his approach. Impelled by \"a mix of commerce, revenge, and pique\", he sensed that war was the ideal way to enhance his glory. In peacetime he concentrated on preparing for the next war. He taught his diplomats that their job was to create tactical and strategic advantages for the French military.Significant achievements during his reign which would go on to have a wide influence on the Early Modern Era well into the Industrial Revolution and up to today, include the construction of the Canal du Midi, the creation of the Palace and Gardens of Versailles, the sponsorship and patronage of such artists and composers as Jean-Baptiste de Lully, Moli\u00e8re, and Hyacinthe Rigaud, as well as the founding of the French Academy of Sciences, among others.", "img_list": ["Q7742_0.jpg", "Q7742_1.jpg", "Q7742_2.jpg", "Q7742_3.jpg", "Q7742_4.svg", "Q7742_5.jpg", "Q7742_6.jpg", "Q7742_7.jpg", "Q7742_8.jpg", "Q7742_9.svg", "Q7742_10.jpg", "Q7742_11.tif", "Q7742_12.tif", "Q7742_13.jpg", "Q7742_14.svg", "Q7742_15.jpg", "Q7742_16.svg", "Q7742_17.PNG", "Q7742_18.png", "Q7742_19.tif", "Q7742_20.jpg", "Q7742_21.svg", "Q7742_22.svg", "Q7742_23.jpg", "Q7742_24.jpg", "Q7742_25.jpg", "Q7742_26.jpg", "Q7742_27.jpg", "Q7742_28.jpg", "Q7742_29.jpg", "Q7742_30.svg", "Q7742_31.jpeg", "Q7742_32.jpg", "Q7742_33.jpg", "Q7742_34.jpg", "Q7742_35.jpg", "Q7742_36.jpg", "Q7742_37.JPG", "Q7742_38.jpg", "Q7742_39.jpg", "Q7742_40.jpg", "Q7742_41.jpg", "Q7742_42.jpg", "Q7742_43.svg", "Q7742_44.svg", "Q7742_45.jpg", "Q7742_46.jpg", "Q7742_47.svg", "Q7742_48.svg", "Q7742_49.svg", "Q7742_50.svg", "Q7742_51.svg", "Q7742_52.svg", "Q7742_53.jpg", "Q7742_55.jpg"], "summary": "Louis XIV of France:Sex: male.

He has been serving in this position since 2012, and he previously held this office from 1999 until 2008. He was also the prime minister from 1999 to 2000, and again from 2008 to 2012. Putin is the second-longest current serving European president.\nPutin was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) and studied law at Leningrad State University, graduating in 1975. Putin worked as a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel, before resigning in 1991 to begin a political career in Saint Petersburg. He later moved to Moscow in 1996 to join the administration of president Boris Yeltsin. He briefly served as director of the Federal Security Service (FSB) and secretary of the Security Council, before being appointed as prime minister in August 1999. After the resignation of Yeltsin, Putin became acting president, and less than four months later was elected outright to his first term as president and was reelected in 2004. As he was then constitutionally limited to two consecutive terms as president, Putin served as prime minister again from 2008 to 2012 under Dmitry Medvedev, and returned to the presidency in 2012 in an election marred by allegations of fraud and protests; he was reelected again in 2018. In April 2021, following a referendum, he signed into law constitutional amendments including one that would allow him to run for reelection twice more, potentially extending his presidency to 2036.During his first tenure as president, the Russian economy grew for eight straight years, with GDP measured by purchasing power increasing by 72%, real incomes increased by a factor of 2.5, real wages more than tripled; unemployment and poverty more than halved and the Russians' self-assessed life satisfaction rose significantly. The growth was a result of a fivefold increase in the price of oil and gas, which constitute the majority of Russian exports, recovery from the post-communist depression and financial crises, a rise in foreign investment, and prudent economic and fiscal policies. Putin also led Russia to victory in the Second Chechen War. Serving as prime minister under Medvedev, he oversaw large-scale military reform and police reform, as well as Russia's victory in the Russo-Georgian War. During his third term as president, falling oil prices coupled with international sanctions imposed at the beginning of 2014 after Russia's military intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea led to GDP shrinking by 3.7% in 2015, though the Russian economy rebounded in 2016 with 0.3% GDP growth. Other developments under Putin has included the construction of pipelines, the restoration of the satellite navigation system GLONASS, and the building of infrastructure for international events such as the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nUnder Putin's leadership, Russia has shifted to authoritarianism. Experts do not generally consider Russia to be a democracy, citing the jailing and repression of political opponents, the intimidation and suppression of the free press and the lack of free and fair elections. Russia has scored poorly on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, and Freedom House's Freedom in the World index.", "img_list": ["Q7747_0.jpg", "Q7747_1.jpg", "Q7747_2.jpg", "Q7747_3.jpg", "Q7747_4.svg", "Q7747_5.jpg", "Q7747_6.jpg", "Q7747_7.svg", "Q7747_8.svg", "Q7747_9.svg", "Q7747_10.svg", "Q7747_11.svg", "Q7747_12.svg", "Q7747_13.svg", "Q7747_14.svg", "Q7747_15.svg", "Q7747_16.svg", "Q7747_17.svg", "Q7747_18.svg", "Q7747_19.svg", "Q7747_20.svg", "Q7747_21.svg", "Q7747_22.svg", "Q7747_23.svg", "Q7747_24.svg", "Q7747_25.svg", "Q7747_26.svg", "Q7747_27.svg", "Q7747_28.svg", "Q7747_29.svg", "Q7747_30.svg", "Q7747_31.svg", "Q7747_32.svg", "Q7747_33.svg", "Q7747_34.svg", "Q7747_35.svg", "Q7747_36.svg", "Q7747_37.svg", "Q7747_38.svg", "Q7747_39.svg", "Q7747_40.svg", "Q7747_41.svg", "Q7747_42.svg", "Q7747_43.svg", "Q7747_44.svg", "Q7747_45.svg", "Q7747_46.svg", "Q7747_47.svg", "Q7747_48.svg", "Q7747_49.svg", "Q7747_50.svg", "Q7747_51.svg", "Q7747_52.svg", "Q7747_53.svg", "Q7747_54.svg", "Q7747_55.svg", "Q7747_56.svg", "Q7747_57.svg", "Q7747_58.svg", "Q7747_59.svg", "Q7747_60.svg", "Q7747_61.svg", "Q7747_62.svg", "Q7747_63.svg", "Q7747_64.svg", "Q7747_65.svg", "Q7747_66.svg", "Q7747_67.svg", "Q7747_68.svg", "Q7747_69.svg", "Q7747_70.svg", "Q7747_71.svg", "Q7747_72.svg", "Q7747_73.svg", "Q7747_74.svg", "Q7747_75.svg", "Q7747_76.svg", "Q7747_77.svg", "Q7747_78.svg", "Q7747_79.svg", "Q7747_80.svg", "Q7747_81.svg", "Q7747_82.svg", "Q7747_83.svg", "Q7747_84.svg", "Q7747_85.svg", "Q7747_86.svg", "Q7747_87.svg", "Q7747_88.svg", "Q7747_89.svg", "Q7747_90.svg", "Q7747_91.svg", "Q7747_92.svg", "Q7747_93.svg", "Q7747_94.svg", "Q7747_95.svg", "Q7747_96.svg", "Q7747_97.svg", "Q7747_98.svg", "Q7747_99.svg", "Q7747_100.svg", "Q7747_101.svg", "Q7747_102.svg", "Q7747_103.svg", "Q7747_104.svg", "Q7747_105.svg", "Q7747_106.svg", "Q7747_107.svg", "Q7747_108.svg", "Q7747_109.svg", "Q7747_110.svg", "Q7747_111.svg", "Q7747_112.svg", "Q7747_113.svg", "Q7747_114.svg", "Q7747_115.svg", "Q7747_116.svg", "Q7747_117.svg", "Q7747_118.svg", "Q7747_119.svg", "Q7747_120.svg", "Q7747_121.svg", "Q7747_122.svg", "Q7747_123.svg", "Q7747_124.svg", "Q7747_125.svg", "Q7747_126.svg", "Q7747_127.svg", "Q7747_128.svg", "Q7747_129.svg", "Q7747_130.svg", "Q7747_131.svg", "Q7747_132.svg", "Q7747_133.svg", "Q7747_134.svg", "Q7747_135.svg", "Q7747_136.svg", "Q7747_137.svg", "Q7747_138.svg", "Q7747_139.svg", "Q7747_140.svg", "Q7747_141.svg", "Q7747_142.svg", "Q7747_143.svg", "Q7747_144.svg", "Q7747_145.svg", "Q7747_146.svg", "Q7747_147.svg", "Q7747_148.svg", "Q7747_149.svg", "Q7747_150.svg", "Q7747_151.svg", "Q7747_152.svg", "Q7747_153.svg", "Q7747_154.svg", "Q7747_155.svg", "Q7747_156.svg", "Q7747_157.svg", "Q7747_158.svg", "Q7747_159.svg", "Q7747_160.svg", "Q7747_161.svg", "Q7747_162.svg", "Q7747_163.svg", "Q7747_164.jpg", "Q7747_165.svg", "Q7747_166.png", "Q7747_167.svg", "Q7747_168.svg", "Q7747_169.png", "Q7747_170.svg", "Q7747_171.jpg", "Q7747_172.jpg", "Q7747_173.jpg", "Q7747_174.jpg", "Q7747_175.JPG", "Q7747_176.svg", "Q7747_177.jpg", "Q7747_178.gif", "Q7747_179.png", "Q7747_180.gif", "Q7747_181.png", "Q7747_182.png", "Q7747_183.png", "Q7747_184.svg", "Q7747_185.jpg", "Q7747_186.png", "Q7747_187.ogg", "Q7747_188.png", "Q7747_189.jpg", "Q7747_190.jpg", "Q7747_191.jpg", "Q7747_192.png", "Q7747_193.jpg", "Q7747_194.png", "Q7747_195.jpg", "Q7747_196.jpg", "Q7747_197.jpg", "Q7747_198.jpg", "Q7747_199.jpg", "Q7747_200.jpg", "Q7747_201.jpg", "Q7747_202.jpg", "Q7747_203.jpg", "Q7747_204.png", "Q7747_205.jpg", "Q7747_206.jpg", "Q7747_207.jpg", "Q7747_208.jpg", "Q7747_209.jpg", "Q7747_210.jpg", "Q7747_211.jpg", "Q7747_212.jpg", "Q7747_213.jpg", "Q7747_214.jpg", "Q7747_215.jpg", "Q7747_216.svg", "Q7747_217.svg", "Q7747_218.jpg", "Q7747_219.jpeg", "Q7747_220.jpg", "Q7747_224.svg", "Q7747_226.svg", "Q7747_233.svg", "Q7747_234.svg", "Q7747_235.svg", "Q7747_236.svg", "Q7747_237.svg", "Q7747_238.svg"], "summary": "Vladimir Putin:Sex: male.

He spent twenty-three years in exile: during the French Revolution and the First French Empire (1804\u20131814), and during the Hundred Days.\nUntil his accession to the throne of France, he held the title of Count of Provence as brother of King Louis XVI. On 21 September 1792, the National Convention abolished the monarchy and deposed Louis XVI, who was later executed by guillotine. When his young nephew Louis XVII died in prison in June 1795, the Count of Provence proclaimed himself (titular) king under the name Louis XVIII.Following the French Revolution and during the Napoleonic era, Louis XVIII lived in exile in Prussia, England, and Russia. When the Sixth Coalition finally defeated Napoleon in 1814, Louis XVIII was placed in what he, and the French royalists, considered his rightful position. However, Napoleon escaped from his exile in Elba and restored his French Empire. Louis XVIII fled, and a Seventh Coalition declared war on the French Empire, defeated Napoleon again, and again restored Louis XVIII to the French throne.\nLouis XVIII ruled as king for slightly less than a decade. The government of the Bourbon Restoration was a constitutional monarchy, unlike the Ancien R\u00e9gime, which was absolutist. As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. His return in 1815 led to a second wave of White Terror headed by the Ultra-royalist faction. The following year, Louis dissolved the unpopular parliament, referred to as the Chambre introuvable, giving rise to the liberal Doctrinaires. His reign was further marked by the formation of the Quintuple Alliance and a military intervention in Spain. Louis had no children, so upon his death the crown passed to his brother, Charles X.

After the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, Charles (as heir-presumptive) became the leader of the ultra-royalists, a radical monarchist faction within the French court that affirmed rule by divine right and opposed the concessions towards liberals and guarantees of civil liberties granted by the Charter of 1814. Charles gained influence within the French court after the assassination of his son Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry, in 1820 and succeeded his brother Louis XVIII in 1824.His reign of almost six years proved to be deeply unpopular amongst the liberals in France from the moment of his coronation in 1825, in which he tried to revive the practice of the royal touch. The governments appointed under his reign reimbursed former landowners for the abolition of feudalism at the expense of bondholders, increased the power of the Catholic Church, and reimposed capital punishment for sacrilege, leading to conflict with the liberal-majority Chamber of Deputies. Charles also approved the French conquest of Algeria as a way to distract his citizens from domestic problems, and forced Haiti to pay a hefty indemnity in return for lifting a blockade and recognizing Haiti's independence. He eventually appointed a conservative government under the premiership of Prince Jules de Polignac, who was defeated in the 1830 French legislative election. He responded with the July Ordinances disbanding the Chamber of Deputies, limiting franchise, and reimposing press censorship. Within a week France faced urban riots which led to the July Revolution of 1830, which resulted in his abdication and the election of Louis Philippe I as King of the French.

He fled to Switzerland in 1793 after being connected with a plot to restore France's monarchy. His father Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (Philippe \u00c9galit\u00e9) fell under suspicion and was executed, and Louis Philippe remained in exile for 21 years until the Bourbon Restoration. He was proclaimed king in 1830 after his fifth cousin Charles X was forced to abdicate by the July Revolution.\nThe reign of Louis Philippe is known as the July Monarchy and was dominated by wealthy industrialists and bankers. He followed conservative policies, especially under the influence of French statesman Fran\u00e7ois Guizot during the period 1840\u20131848.

As a member of the Democratic Party, he won a record four presidential elections and became a central figure in world events during the first half of the 20th century. Roosevelt directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing his New Deal domestic agenda in response to the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. As a dominant leader of his party, he built the New Deal Coalition, which defined modern liberalism in the United States throughout the middle third of the 20th century. His third and fourth terms were dominated by World War II, which ended shortly after he died in office.\nBorn into the Roosevelt family in Hyde Park, New York, he graduated from both Groton School and Harvard College, and attended Columbia Law School, which he left after passing the bar exam to practice law in New York City. In 1905, he married his fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt. They had six children, of whom five survived into adulthood. He won election to the New York State Senate in 1910, and then served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's 1920 national ticket, but Cox was defeated by Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness, believed at the time to be polio, and his legs became permanently paralyzed. While attempting to recover from his condition, Roosevelt founded a polio rehabilitation center in Warm Springs, Georgia. Although unable to walk unaided, Roosevelt returned to public office after his election as governor of New York in 1928. He served as governor from 1929 to 1933, promoting programs to combat the economic crisis besetting the United States.\nIn the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican incumbent Herbert Hoover in a landslide. He took office in the midst of the Great Depression and during the first 100 days of the 73rd U.S. Congress, he spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation. He also issued a profusion of executive orders that instituted the New Deal\u2014a variety of programs designed to produce relief, recovery, and reform. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other agencies. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. He used radio to speak directly to the American people, giving 30 \"fireside chat\" radio addresses during his presidency and became the first American president to be televised. The economy improved rapidly from 1933 to 1936, and Roosevelt won a landslide reelection in 1936. After the election, he sought passage of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937 (or \"court packing plan\"), intending to expand the size of the Supreme Court. The bill was blocked by the newly formed bipartisan Conservative Coalition. The economy then relapsed into the recession of 1937\u20131938. Other major 1930s legislation and agencies implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Social Security, and the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nHe was reelected in 1940 for his third term, making him the only U.S. president to serve for more than two terms. With World War II looming after 1938, the U.S. remained officially neutral, but Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China, the United Kingdom, and eventually the Soviet Union. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, an event he called \"a date which will live in infamy\", Roosevelt obtained a congressional declaration of war on Japan. When Germany and Italy declared war on the US in response, the US formally entered the European theater of the war.  Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the U.S. economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy, initiating the Lend-Lease program and making the defeat of Germany first a priority over that of Japan. His administration oversaw the construction of The Pentagon, initiated the development of the world's first atomic bomb, and worked with other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions. It was under his wartime leadership that the United States became a superpower on the world stage.\nRoosevelt won reelection in the 1944 presidential election on his post-war recovery platform. His physical health began declining during the later war years, and less than three months into his fourth term, Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Vice President Harry S. Truman assumed office as president and oversaw the acceptance of surrender by the Axis powers. Some of Roosevelt's actions have faced substantial criticism, such as his ordering of the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans, as well as his decision to break tradition by running for a third term. Nevertheless, he is consistently ranked by scholars, political scientists, and historians as being among the nation's three greatest presidents.", "img_list": ["Q8007_0.jpg", "Q8007_1.jpg", "Q8007_2.jpg", "Q8007_3.jpg", "Q8007_4.jpg", "Q8007_5.jpg", "Q8007_6.svg", "Q8007_7.svg", "Q8007_8.svg", "Q8007_9.svg", "Q8007_10.ogg", "Q8007_11.jpg", "Q8007_12.jpg", "Q8007_13.jpg", "Q8007_14.jpg", "Q8007_15.jpg", "Q8007_16.svg", "Q8007_17.ogg", "Q8007_18.ogv", "Q8007_19.ogv", "Q8007_20.svg", "Q8007_21.svg", "Q8007_22.svg", "Q8007_23.jpg", "Q8007_24.jpg", "Q8007_25.jpg", "Q8007_26.jpg", "Q8007_27.jpg", "Q8007_28.jpg", "Q8007_29.svg", "Q8007_30.jpg", "Q8007_31.jpg", "Q8007_32.jpg", "Q8007_33.svg", "Q8007_34.jpg", "Q8007_35.jpg", "Q8007_36.svg", "Q8007_37.svg", "Q8007_38.png", "Q8007_39.jpg", "Q8007_40.png", "Q8007_41.ogg", "Q8007_42.jpg", "Q8007_43.svg", "Q8007_44.ogv", "Q8007_45.jpg", "Q8007_46.svg", "Q8007_47.jpg", "Q8007_48.svg", "Q8007_49.svg", "Q8007_50.jpg", "Q8007_51.svg", "Q8007_52.svg", "Q8007_53.svg", "Q8007_54.jpg", "Q8007_55.png", "Q8007_56.png", "Q8007_57.svg", "Q8007_60.jpg", "Q8007_64.ogg", "Q8007_69.jpg", "Q8007_71.jpg"], "summary": "Franklin D.

Best known for his wartime leadership as Prime Minister, Churchill was also a Sandhurst-educated soldier, a Boer War hero, a Nobel Prize-winning writer and historian, a prolific painter, and one of the longest-serving politicians in British history. Apart from two years between 1922 and 1924, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1964 and represented a total of five constituencies. Ideologically an economic liberal and imperialist, he was for most of his career a member of the Conservative Party, which he led from 1940 to 1955. He was a member of the Liberal Party from 1904 to 1924.\nOf mixed English and American parentage, Churchill was born in Oxfordshire to a wealthy, aristocratic family. He joined the British Army in 1895 and saw action in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War, and the Second Boer War, gaining fame as a war correspondent and writing books about his campaigns. Elected a Conservative MP in 1900, he defected to the Liberals in 1904. In H. H. Asquith's Liberal government, Churchill served as President of the Board of Trade and Home Secretary, championing prison reform and workers' social security. As First Lord of the Admiralty during the First World War, he oversaw the Gallipoli Campaign but, after it proved a disaster, he was demoted to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He resigned in November 1915 and joined the Royal Scots Fusiliers on the Western Front for six months. In 1917, he returned to government under David Lloyd George and served successively as Minister of Munitions, Secretary of State for War, Secretary of State for Air, and Secretary of State for the Colonies, overseeing the Anglo-Irish Treaty and British foreign policy in the Middle East. After two years out of Parliament, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government, returning the pound sterling in 1925 to the gold standard at its pre-war parity, a move widely seen as creating deflationary pressure and depressing the UK economy.\nOut of government during his so-called \"wilderness years\" in the 1930s, Churchill took the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. At the outbreak of the Second World War he was re-appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In May 1940, he became Prime Minister, replacing Neville Chamberlain. Churchill formed a national government and oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers, resulting in victory in 1945. After the Conservatives' defeat in the 1945 general election, he became Leader of the Opposition. Amid the developing Cold War with the Soviet Union, he publicly warned of an \"iron curtain\" of Soviet influence in Europe and promoted European unity. He lost the 1950 election, but was returned to office in 1951. His second term was preoccupied with foreign affairs, especially Anglo-American relations and the preservation of the British Empire. Domestically, his government emphasised house-building and completed the development of a nuclear weapon (begun by his predecessor). In declining health, Churchill resigned as Prime Minister in 1955, although he remained an MP until 1964. Upon his death in 1965, he was given a state funeral.\nWidely considered one of the 20th century's most significant figures, Churchill remains popular in the UK and Western world, where he is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism. He is also praised as a social reformer. However, he has been criticised for some wartime events \u2013 notably the area bombing of German cities and his government's response to the Bengal famine \u2013 and also for his imperialist views, including comments on race.", "img_list": ["Q8016_0.jpg", "Q8016_1.jpeg", "Q8016_2.svg", "Q8016_3.jpg", "Q8016_4.png", "Q8016_5.jpg", "Q8016_6.JPG", "Q8016_7.jpg", "Q8016_8.jpg", "Q8016_9.jpg", "Q8016_10.jpg", "Q8016_11.jpg", "Q8016_12.jpg", "Q8016_13.jpg", "Q8016_14.jpg", "Q8016_15.jpg", "Q8016_16.svg", "Q8016_17.svg", "Q8016_18.svg", "Q8016_19.svg", "Q8016_20.jpg", "Q8016_21.jpg", "Q8016_22.jpg", "Q8016_23.jpg", "Q8016_24.jpg", "Q8016_25.jpg", "Q8016_26.jpg", "Q8016_27.svg", "Q8016_28.jpg", "Q8016_29.jpg", "Q8016_30.svg", "Q8016_31.jpg", "Q8016_32.svg", "Q8016_33.jpg", "Q8016_34.jpg", "Q8016_35.jpg", "Q8016_36.svg", "Q8016_37.jpg", "Q8016_38.svg", "Q8016_39.svg", "Q8016_40.svg", "Q8016_41.gif", "Q8016_42.jpg", "Q8016_43.jpg", "Q8016_44.jpg", "Q8016_45.jpg", "Q8016_46.jpg", "Q8016_47.jpg", "Q8016_48.jpg", "Q8016_49.jpg", "Q8016_50.jpg", "Q8016_51.jpg", "Q8016_58.jpg", "Q8016_61.jpg"], "summary": "Winston Churchill:Sex: male.

He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.\nA Xhosa speaker, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, Union of South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.\nMandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.\nMandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. Although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He is held in deep respect within South Africa, where he is often referred to by his Thembu clan name, Madiba, and described as the \"Father of the Nation\".", "img_list": ["Q8023_0.jpg", "Q8023_1.jpg", "Q8023_2.svg", "Q8023_3.svg", "Q8023_4.svg", "Q8023_5.jpg", "Q8023_6.jpg", "Q8023_7.jpg", "Q8023_8.jpg", "Q8023_9.jpg", "Q8023_10.jpg", "Q8023_11.jpg", "Q8023_12.jpg", "Q8023_13.jpg", "Q8023_14.jpg", "Q8023_15.jpg", "Q8023_16.JPG", "Q8023_17.jpg", "Q8023_18.jpg", "Q8023_19.jpg", "Q8023_20.svg", "Q8023_21.jpg", "Q8023_22.svg", "Q8023_23.svg", "Q8023_24.JPG", "Q8023_25.jpg", "Q8023_26.jpg", "Q8023_27.jpg", "Q8023_28.jpg", "Q8023_29.svg", "Q8023_30.svg", "Q8023_31.svg", "Q8023_32.svg", "Q8023_33.svg", "Q8023_34.jpg", "Q8023_37.jpg", "Q8023_40.svg"], "summary": "Nelson Mandela:Sex: male.

An African American leader in the church and the son of early civil rights activist and minister Martin Luther King Sr., King advanced civil rights for people of color in the United States through nonviolence and civil disobedience, inspired by his Christian beliefs and the nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi.\nKing participated in and led marches for the right to vote, desegregation, labor rights, and other civil rights. He oversaw the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and later became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As president of the SCLC, he led the unsuccessful Albany Movement in Albany, Georgia, and helped organize some of the nonviolent 1963 protests in Birmingham, Alabama. King was one of the leaders of the 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  The civil rights movement achieved pivotal legislative gains in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\nThe SCLC put into practice the tactics of nonviolent protest with some success by strategically choosing the methods and places in which protests were carried out. There were several dramatic stand-offs with segregationist authorities, who sometimes turned violent.  Several times King would be jailed.  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director J. Edgar Hoover considered King a radical and made him an object of the FBI's COINTELPRO from 1963, forward. FBI agents investigated him for possible communist ties, spied on his personal life and secretly recorded him, and in 1964, mailed King a threatening anonymous letter, which he interpreted as an attempt to make him commit suicide.On October 14, 1964, King won the Nobel Peace Prize for combating racial inequality through nonviolent resistance. In 1965, he helped organize two of the three Selma to Montgomery marches. In his final years, he expanded his focus to include opposition towards poverty, capitalism, and the Vietnam War. In 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was assassinated on April 4 in Memphis, Tennessee. His death was followed by national mourning, as well as anger leading to riots in many U.S. cities.  King was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2003. Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established as a holiday in cities and states throughout the United States beginning in 1971; the holiday was enacted at the federal level by legislation signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986. Hundreds of streets in the U.S. have been renamed in his honor, and the most populous county in Washington State was rededicated for him. The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., was dedicated in 2011.", "img_list": ["Q8027_0.jpg", "Q8027_1.jpg", "Q8027_2.ogv", "Q8027_3.jpg", "Q8027_4.PNG", "Q8027_5.tif", "Q8027_6.jpg", "Q8027_7.jpg", "Q8027_8.pdf", "Q8027_9.svg", "Q8027_10.svg", "Q8027_11.svg", "Q8027_12.jpg", "Q8027_13.jpg", "Q8027_14.png", "Q8027_15.jpg", "Q8027_16.jpg", "Q8027_17.jpg", "Q8027_18.jpg", "Q8027_19.jpg", "Q8027_20.svg", "Q8027_21.jpg", "Q8027_22.jpg", "Q8027_23.jpg", "Q8027_24.jpg", "Q8027_25.jpg", "Q8027_26.png", "Q8027_27.JPG", "Q8027_28.tif", "Q8027_29.tiff", "Q8027_30.jpg", "Q8027_31.svg", "Q8027_33.svg", "Q8027_34.svg", "Q8027_35.svg", "Q8027_36.svg", "Q8027_37.jpg", "Q8027_42.jpg", "Q8027_43.jpg", "Q8027_46.jpg"], "summary": "Martin Luther King Jr.:Sex: male.

He succeeded his father, Charles VII.\nLouis entered into open rebellion against his father in a short-lived revolt known as the Praguerie in 1440. The king forgave his rebellious vassals, including Louis, to whom he entrusted the management of the Dauphin\u00e9, then a province in southeastern France. Louis's ceaseless intrigues, however, led his father to banish him from court. From the Dauphin\u00e9, Louis led his own political establishment and married Charlotte of Savoy, daughter of Louis, Duke of Savoy, against the will of his father. Charles VII sent an army to compel his son to his will, but Louis fled to Burgundy, where he was hosted by Philip the Good, the Duke of Burgundy, Charles' greatest enemy.\nWhen Charles VII died in 1461, Louis left the Burgundian court to take possession of his kingdom. His taste for intrigue and his intense diplomatic activity earned him the nicknames \"the Cunning\" (Middle French: le rus\u00e9) and \"the Universal Spider\" (Middle French: l'universelle aragne), as his enemies accused him of spinning webs of plots and conspiracies.\nIn 1472, the subsequent Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, took up arms against his rival Louis. However, Louis was able to isolate Charles from his English allies by signing the Treaty of Picquigny (1475) with Edward IV of England. The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War. With the death of Charles the Bold at the Battle of Nancy in 1477, the dynasty of the dukes of Burgundy died out. Louis took advantage of the situation to seize numerous Burgundian territories, including Burgundy itself and Picardy.\nWithout direct foreign threats, Louis was able to eliminate his rebellious vassals, expand royal power, and strengthen the economic development of his country. He died on 30 August 1483, and was succeeded by his minor son Charles VIII.", "img_list": ["Q8058_0.svg", "Q8058_1.jpg", "Q8058_2.jpg", "Q8058_3.jpg", "Q8058_4.jpg", "Q8058_5.jpg", "Q8058_6.svg", "Q8058_7.jpg", "Q8058_8.PNG", "Q8058_9.png"], "summary": "Louis XI of France:Sex: male.

A member of the Argead dynasty, he was born in Pella\u2014a city in Ancient Greece\u2014in 356 BC. He succeeded his father King Philip II to the throne at the age of 20, and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia and Northeastern Africa. By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders.\n\nDuring his youth, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle until the age of 16. His father Philip was assassinated in 336 BC at the wedding of Cleopatra of Macedon, Alexander's sister, and Alexander assumed the throne of the Kingdom of Macedon. After sacking the city of Thebes, Alexander was awarded the generalship of Greece. He used his authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project, which involved him assuming the leadership position to all the Greeks in their conquest of Persia.In 334 BC he invaded the Achaemenid Empire (Persian Empire) and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years. Following his conquest of Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, including those at Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River. Alexander endeavored to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and invaded India in 326 BC, achieving an important victory over King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes. He eventually turned back at the Beas River due to the demand of his homesick troops, dying in 323 BC in Babylon, the city he planned to establish as his capital. He did not manage to execute a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart.\nAlexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism. He founded more than twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture resulted in Hellenistic civilization, which developed through the Roman Empire into modern Western culture. The Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire up until its end in the mid-15th century AD.  Greek-speaking communities in central and far eastern Anatolia survived until the Greek genocide and the population exchange in the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, featuring prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. His military achievements and enduring, unprecedented success in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves. Military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics.\n\n", "img_list": ["Q8409_0.JPG", "Q8409_1.JPG", "Q8409_2.jpg", "Q8409_3.jpg", "Q8409_4.JPG", "Q8409_5.jpg", "Q8409_6.jpg", "Q8409_7.jpg", "Q8409_8.jpg", "Q8409_9.jpg", "Q8409_10.jpg", "Q8409_11.jpg", "Q8409_12.jpg", "Q8409_13.jpg", "Q8409_14.jpg", "Q8409_15.jpg", "Q8409_16.jpg", "Q8409_17.png", "Q8409_18.png", "Q8409_19.png", "Q8409_20.png", "Q8409_21.png", "Q8409_22.JPG", "Q8409_23.JPG", "Q8409_24.jpg", "Q8409_25.jpg", "Q8409_26.png", "Q8409_27.jpeg", "Q8409_28.svg", "Q8409_29.svg", "Q8409_30.svg", "Q8409_31.jpeg", "Q8409_32.svg", "Q8409_33.png", "Q8409_34.svg", "Q8409_35.svg", "Q8409_36.jpg", "Q8409_37.jpg", "Q8409_38.jpg", "Q8409_39.svg", "Q8409_40.svg", "Q8409_41.jpg", "Q8409_42.jpg", "Q8409_43.jpg", "Q8409_44.jpg", "Q8409_45.svg", "Q8409_46.jpg", "Q8409_47.jpg", "Q8409_48.svg", "Q8409_49.jpeg", "Q8409_50.jpg", "Q8409_51.jpg", "Q8409_52.svg", "Q8409_53.JPG", "Q8409_54.jpg", "Q8409_55.jpg", "Q8409_56.jpg", "Q8409_57.jpg", "Q8409_58.svg", "Q8409_59.svg", "Q8409_60.svg", "Q8409_61.svg", "Q8409_62.svg", "Q8409_63.svg", "Q8409_65.jpg", "Q8409_66.jpg"], "summary": "Alexander the Great:Sex: male.

Born in Naissus, Dacia Mediterranea (now Ni\u0161, Serbia), he was the son of Flavius Constantius (a Roman army officer born in Dacia Ripensis who had been one of the four emperors of the Tetrarchy). His mother, Helena, was Greek and of low birth. Constantine served with distinction under the Roman emperors Diocletian and Galerius. He began by campaigning in the eastern provinces (against barbarians, and the Persians) before he was recalled in the west (in 305 AD) to fight alongside his father in Britain. After his father's death in 306, Constantine became emperor; he was acclaimed by his army at Eboracum (York, England). He emerged victorious in the civil wars against emperors Maxentius and Licinius to become the sole ruler of the Roman Empire by 324.\nUpon his ascension to emperor, Constantine enacted numerous reforms to strengthen the empire. He restructured the government, separating civil and military authorities. To combat inflation he introduced the solidus, a new gold coin that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years. The Roman army was reorganised to consist of mobile units (comitatenses), and garrison troops (limitanei) capable of countering internal threats and barbarian invasions. Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers\u2014such as the Franks, the Alamanni, the Goths and the Sarmatians\u2014even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the Crisis of the Third Century with citizens of Roman culture once more.\nConstantine was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity. Although he lived much of his life as a pagan, and later as a catechumen, he began to favor Christianity beginning in 312, finally becoming a Christian and being baptised by either Eusebius of Nicomedia, an Arian bishop, as attested by many notable Arian historical figures, or Pope Sylvester I, which is maintained by the Catholic Church and the Coptic Orthodox Church. He played an influential role in the proclamation of the Edict of Milan in 313, which declared tolerance for Christianity in the Roman Empire. He convoked the First Council of Nicaea in 325, which produced the statement of Christian belief known as the Nicene Creed. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built on his orders at the purported site of Jesus' tomb in Jerusalem and was deemed the holiest place in all of Christendom. The papal claim to temporal power in the High Middle Ages was based on the fabricated Donation of Constantine. He has historically been referred to as the \"First Christian Emperor\" and he did favour the Christian Church. While some modern scholars debate his beliefs and even his comprehension of Christianity, he is venerated as a saint in Eastern Christianity, and did much for pushing Christianity towards the mainstream of Roman culture.\nThe age of Constantine marked a distinct epoch in the history of the Roman Empire and a pivotal moment in the transition from classical antiquity to the Middle Ages. He built a new imperial residence at the city of Byzantium and renamed it Constantinople (now Istanbul) after himself. It subsequently became the capital of the empire for more than a thousand years, the later Eastern Roman Empire being referred to as the Byzantine Empire by modern historians. His more immediate political legacy was that he replaced Diocletian's Tetrarchy with the de facto principle of dynastic succession, by leaving the empire to his sons and other members of the Constantinian dynasty. His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and for centuries after his reign. The medieval church held him up as a paragon of virtue, while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity. Beginning with the Renaissance, there were more critical appraisals of his reign, due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources.

Under his rule, the empire embraced all of the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Western Asia and much of Central Asia. Spanning from the Mediterranean Sea and Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east, the empire created by Cyrus was the largest the world had yet seen. At its maximum extent under his successors, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from parts of the Balkans (Eastern Bulgaria\u2013Paeonia and Thrace\u2013Macedonia) and Southeast Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east.\nThe reign of Cyrus lasted about thirty years; his empire took root with his conquest of the Median Empire followed by the Lydian Empire and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire. He also led an expedition into Central Asia, which resulted in major campaigns that were described as having brought \"into subjection every nation without exception\". Cyrus did not venture into Egypt, and was alleged to have died in battle while fighting the Massagetae along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC. However, Xenophon claimed that Cyrus did not die in battle and returned to the Achaemenid ceremonial capital of Persepolis again. He was succeeded by his son, Cambyses II, who managed to conquer Egypt, Nubia and Cyrenaica during his short rule.\nCyrus is well-known for having respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered. He was important in developing the system of a central administration at Pasargadae governing satraps in the empire's border regions, which worked very effectively and profitably for both rulers and subjects. The Edict of Restoration, a proclamation attested by a cylinder seal in which Cyrus authorized and encouraged the return of the Israelites to the Land of Israel following his conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, is described in the Bible and likewise left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion due to his role in ending the Babylonian captivity and facilitating the Jewish return to Zion. According to Isaiah 45:1 of the Hebrew Bible, God anointed Cyrus for this task, even referring to him as a messiah (lit.\u2009'anointed one'); Cyrus is the only non-Jewish figure in the Bible to be revered in this capacity.Cyrus is also recognized for his achievements in human rights, politics, and military strategy, as well as his influence on both Eastern and Western civilizations. The Achaemenid influence in the ancient world would eventually extend as far as Athens, where upper-class Athenians adopted aspects of the culture of the ruling class of Achaemenid Persia as their own. Having originated from Persis, roughly corresponding to the modern-day Fars Province of Iran, Cyrus has played a crucial role in defining the national identity of modern Iran. He remains a cult figure amongst modern Iranians, with his tomb serving as a spot of reverence for millions of people. In the 1970s, the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, identified Cyrus' famous proclamation inscribed onto the Cyrus Cylinder as the oldest-known declaration of human rights, and the Cylinder has since been popularized as such. This view has been criticized by some Western historians as a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a traditional statement that new monarchs make at the beginning of their reign.\n\n", "img_list": ["Q8423_0.jpg", "Q8423_1.svg", "Q8423_2.jpg", "Q8423_3.jpg", "Q8423_4.JPG", "Q8423_5.jpg", "Q8423_6.jpg", "Q8423_7.jpg", "Q8423_8.jpg", "Q8423_9.jpg", "Q8423_10.jpg", "Q8423_11.JPG", "Q8423_12.jpg", "Q8423_13.jpg", "Q8423_14.jpg", "Q8423_15.jpg", "Q8423_16.svg", "Q8423_17.svg", "Q8423_18.svg", "Q8423_19.svg", "Q8423_20.png", "Q8423_21.jpg", "Q8423_22.png", "Q8423_23.jpg", "Q8423_24.jpg", "Q8423_25.svg", "Q8423_26.svg"], "summary": "Cyrus the Great:Sex: male.

Ch\u00e1vez was also leader of the Fifth Republic Movement political party from its foundation in 1997 until 2007, when it merged with several other parties to form the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), which he led until 2012.\nBorn into a middle-class family in Sabaneta, Barinas, Ch\u00e1vez became a career military officer and, after becoming dissatisfied with the Venezuelan political system based on the Puntofijo Pact, he founded the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200) in the early 1980s. Ch\u00e1vez led the MBR-200 in its unsuccessful coup d'\u00e9tat against the Democratic Action government of President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez in 1992, for which he was imprisoned. Pardoned from prison two years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement political party, and then receiving 56.2% of the vote, was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000 with 59.8% of the vote and again in 2006 with 62.8% of the vote. After winning his fourth term as president in the October 2012 presidential election with a decrease to 55.1% of the vote, he was to be sworn in on 10 January 2013. However, the inauguration was postponed due to his cancer treatment, and on 5 March 2013 at age 58, he died in Caracas.Following the adoption of a new constitution in 1999, Ch\u00e1vez focused on enacting social reforms as part of the Bolivarian Revolution. Using record-high oil revenues of the 2000s, his government nationalized key industries, created participatory democratic Communal Councils and implemented social programs known as the Bolivarian missions to expand access to food, housing, healthcare and education. The high oil profits coinciding with the start of Chavez's presidency resulted in temporary improvements in areas such as poverty, literacy, income equality and quality of life between primarily 2003 and 2007, though extensive changes in structural inequalities did not occur. On 2 June 2010, Ch\u00e1vez declared an \"economic war\" on Venezuela's upper classes due to shortages, arguably beginning the crisis in Venezuela. By the end of Ch\u00e1vez's presidency in the early 2010s, economic actions performed by his government during the preceding decade, such as deficit spending and price controls, proved to be unsustainable, with Venezuela's economy faltering. At the same time, poverty, inflation and shortages increased.\nCritics of Ch\u00e1vez state that Venezuela experienced democratic backsliding under his tenure, with accusations that he suppressed the press, manipulated electoral laws, and arrested and exiled government critics. His use of enabling acts and his government's use of propaganda were controversial. Ch\u00e1vez's presidency saw significant increases in the country's murder rate and continued corruption within the police force and government.Internationally, Ch\u00e1vez aligned himself with the Marxist\u2013Leninist governments of Fidel and then Ra\u00fal Castro in Cuba, as well as the socialist governments of Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. His presidency was seen as a part of the socialist \"pink tide\" sweeping Latin America. Ch\u00e1vez described his policies as anti-imperialist, being a prominent adversary of the United States's foreign policy as well as a vocal critic of U.S.-supported neoliberalism and laissez-faire capitalism. He described himself as a Marxist. He supported Latin American and Caribbean cooperation and was instrumental in setting up the pan-regional Union of South American Nations, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, the Bank of the South and the regional television network TeleSUR.

From his base in the upper-class of Junker landowners, Bismarck rose rapidly in Prussian politics. He masterminded the unification of Germany in 1871 and served as its first chancellor until 1890, in which capacity he dominated European affairs for two decades. He had served as the chancellor of the North German Confederation from 1867 to 1871 and alongside the office of chancellor of Germany, he was Prussia's minister president and the minister of Foreign Affairs from 1862 to 1890. Before his rise to the executive power, Bismarck was the Prussian ambassador to France and Russia and served in both houses of the Prussian Parliament. He cooperated with King Wilhelm I of Prussia to unify the various German states, a partnership that would last for the rest of Wilhelm's life. King Wilhelm granted Chancellor Bismarck the titles of Count of Bismarck-Sch\u00f6nhausen in 1865 and Prince of Bismarck in 1871. Bismarck provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. Following the victory against Austria, he abolished the supranational German Confederation and instead formed the North German Confederation as the first German national state, aligning the smaller North German states behind Prussia, and excluding Austria.  Receiving the support of the independent South German states in the Confederation's defeat of France, he formed the German Empire \u2013 which also excluded Austria \u2013 and united Germany.\nWith Prussian dominance accomplished by 1871, Bismarck skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a peaceful Europe. To historian Eric Hobsbawm, Bismarck \"remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers\". However, his annexation of Alsace\u2013Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and Germanophobia. Bismarck's diplomacy of Realpolitik and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the Iron Chancellor. German unification and its rapid economic growth was the foundation to his foreign policy. He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an overseas empire when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion. Juggling a very complex interlocking series of conferences, negotiations and alliances, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain Germany's position.\nA master of complex politics at home, Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern world, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist opponents. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the low-tariff, anti-Catholic Liberals and fought the Catholic Church in what was called the Kulturkampf (\"culture struggle\"). He lost that battle as the Catholics responded by forming the powerful German Centre Party and using universal male suffrage to gain a bloc of seats. Bismarck then reversed himself, ended the Kulturkampf, broke with the Liberals, imposed protective tariffs, and formed a political alliance with the Centre Party to fight the Socialists. A devout Lutheran, he was loyal to his ruler, Kaiser Wilhelm I, who argued with Bismarck but in the end supported him against the advice of his wife Empress Augusta and his heir Crown Prince Frederick William. While Germany's parliament was elected by universal male suffrage, it did not have much control of government policy. Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional Junker elite that consisted of the landed nobility in eastern Prussia. In his role as chancellor, he largely controlled domestic and foreign affairs. The year 1888 saw a quick transition on the German throne from Wilhelm I to his son Frederick III to Frederick's son Wilhelm II. The headstrong Kaiser Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck from office. He retired to write his memoirs.\nBismarck was strong-willed, outspoken and overbearing, but he could also be polite, charming and witty. Occasionally he displayed a violent temper \u2013 which he sometimes feigned to get the results he wanted \u2013 and he kept his power by melodramatically threatening resignation time and again, which cowed Wilhelm I. He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision but also the short-term ability to juggle complex developments. Bismarck became a hero to German nationalists; they built many monuments honoring the founder of the new Reich. Many historians praise him as a visionary who was instrumental in uniting Germany and, once that had been accomplished, kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy. Historian Robert K. Massie has noted Bismarck's popular image was as \"gruff\" and \"militaristic\", while in reality \"Bismarck's tool was aggressive, ruthless diplomacy.\"", "img_list": ["Q8442_0.jpg", "Q8442_1.jpg", "Q8442_2.png", "Q8442_3.jpg", "Q8442_4.jpg", "Q8442_5.jpg", "Q8442_6.gif", "Q8442_7.svg", "Q8442_8.jpg", "Q8442_9.jpg", "Q8442_10.ogg", "Q8442_11.svg", "Q8442_12.svg", "Q8442_13.svg", "Q8442_14.svg", "Q8442_15.png", "Q8442_16.svg", "Q8442_17.svg", "Q8442_18.svg", "Q8442_19.svg", "Q8442_20.svg", "Q8442_21.svg", "Q8442_22.svg", "Q8442_23.svg", "Q8442_24.svg", "Q8442_25.svg", "Q8442_26.svg", "Q8442_27.svg", "Q8442_28.svg", "Q8442_29.svg", "Q8442_30.svg", "Q8442_31.svg", "Q8442_32.svg", "Q8442_33.svg", "Q8442_34.svg", "Q8442_35.svg", "Q8442_36.svg", "Q8442_37.svg", "Q8442_38.svg", "Q8442_39.svg", "Q8442_40.svg", "Q8442_41.svg", "Q8442_42.svg", "Q8442_43.svg", "Q8442_44.svg", "Q8442_45.svg", "Q8442_46.svg", "Q8442_47.svg", "Q8442_48.svg", "Q8442_49.svg", "Q8442_50.svg", "Q8442_51.svg", "Q8442_52.svg", "Q8442_53.svg", "Q8442_54.svg", "Q8442_55.svg", "Q8442_56.svg", "Q8442_57.svg", "Q8442_58.svg", "Q8442_59.svg", "Q8442_60.svg", "Q8442_61.svg", "Q8442_62.svg", "Q8442_63.svg", "Q8442_64.svg", "Q8442_65.jpg", "Q8442_66.jpg", "Q8442_67.jpg", "Q8442_68.jpg", "Q8442_69.jpg", "Q8442_70.png", "Q8442_71.jpg", "Q8442_72.jpg", "Q8442_73.svg", "Q8442_74.svg", "Q8442_75.svg", "Q8442_76.JPG", "Q8442_77.svg", "Q8442_78.jpg", "Q8442_79.jpg", "Q8442_80.JPG", "Q8442_81.svg", "Q8442_82.jpg", "Q8442_83.JPG", "Q8442_84.svg", "Q8442_85.jpg", "Q8442_86.svg", "Q8442_87.svg", "Q8442_88.svg", "Q8442_89.svg", "Q8442_90.jpg", "Q8442_91.svg", "Q8442_92.svg", "Q8442_93.svg", "Q8442_94.jpg"], "summary": "Otto von Bismarck:Sex: male.

Belgrade fell to him in 1521 and the island of Rhodes in 1522\u201323. At Moh\u00e1cs, in August 1526, Suleiman broke the military strength of Hungary.\nSuleiman became a prominent monarch of 16th-century Europe, presiding over the apex of the Ottoman Empire's economic, military and political power. Suleiman personally led Ottoman armies in conquering the Christian strongholds of Belgrade and Rhodes as well as most of Hungary before his conquests were checked at the siege of Vienna in 1529. He annexed much of the Middle East in his conflict with the Safavids and large areas of North Africa as far west as Algeria. Under his rule, the Ottoman fleet dominated the seas from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea and through the Persian Gulf.:\u200a61\u200aAt the helm of an expanding empire, Suleiman personally instituted major judicial changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law. His reforms, carried out in conjunction with the empire's chief judicial official Ebussuud Efendi, harmonized the relationship between the two forms of Ottoman law: sultanic (Kanun) and religious (Sharia). He was a distinguished poet and goldsmith; he also became a great patron of culture, overseeing the \"Golden\" age of the Ottoman Empire in its artistic, literary and architectural development.Breaking with Ottoman tradition, Suleiman married H\u00fcrrem Sultan, a woman from his harem, an Orthodox Christian of Ruthenian origin who converted to Islam, and who became famous in the West by the name Roxelana, due to her red hair. Their son, Selim II, succeeded Suleiman following his death in 1566 after 46 years of rule. Suleiman's other potential heirs, Mehmed and Mustafa, had died; Mehmed had died in 1543 from smallpox, and Mustafa had been strangled to death in 1553 at the sultan's order. His other son Bayezid was executed in 1561 on Suleiman's orders, along with Bayezid's four sons, after a rebellion. Although scholars prefer \"crisis and adaptation\" rather than decline after his death, the end of Suleiman's reign was a watershed in Ottoman history. In the decades after Suleiman, the empire began to experience significant political, institutional, and economic changes, a phenomenon often referred to as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire.:\u200a11\u200a", "img_list": ["Q8474_0.jpg", "Q8474_1.svg", "Q8474_2.jpg", "Q8474_3.jpg", "Q8474_4.jpg", "Q8474_5.jpg", "Q8474_6.jpg", "Q8474_7.jpg", "Q8474_8.jpg", "Q8474_9.jpg", "Q8474_10.svg", "Q8474_11.png", "Q8474_12.jpg", "Q8474_13.jpg", "Q8474_14.jpg", "Q8474_15.jpg", "Q8474_16.jpg", "Q8474_17.jpg", "Q8474_18.jpg", "Q8474_19.jpg", "Q8474_20.jpg", "Q8474_21.jpg", "Q8474_22.jpg", "Q8474_23.jpg", "Q8474_24.svg", "Q8474_25.jpg"], "summary": "Suleiman the Magnificent:Sex: male.

He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, Westernised and based on the Enlightenment. Peter's reforms had a lasting impact on Russia, and many institutions of the Russian government trace their origins to his reign.

He is called the \"Father of the Nation\" in the Republic of China, and the \"Forerunner of the Revolution\" in the People's Republic of China for his instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution. Sun is unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for being widely revered in both  China and Taiwan.Sun is considered to be one of the greatest leaders of modern China, but his political life was one of constant struggle and frequent exile. After the success of the revolution in 1911, he quickly resigned as President of the newly founded Republic of China and relinquished it to Yuan Shikai. He soon went to exile in Japan for safety but returned to found a revolutionary government in the South as a challenge to the warlords who controlled much of the nation. In 1923, he invited representatives of the Communist International to Canton to re-organize his party and formed a brittle alliance with the Chinese Communist Party. He did not live to see his party unify the country under his successor, Chiang Kai-shek, in the Northern Expedition. He died in Beijing of gallbladder cancer on 12 March 1925.Sun's chief legacy is his political philosophy known as the Three Principles of the People: M\u00ednz\u00fa (\u6c11\u65cf\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednz\u00fa Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or nationalism (independence from foreign domination), M\u00ednqu\u00e1n (\u6c11\u6b0a\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednqu\u00e1n Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or \"rights of the people\" (sometimes translated as \"democracy\"), and M\u00ednsh\u0113ng (\u6c11\u751f\u4e3b\u7fa9, M\u00ednsh\u0113ng Zh\u01d4y\u00ec) or people's livelihood (sometimes translated as \"communitarianism\" or \"welfare\").", "img_list": ["Q8573_0.png", "Q8573_1.svg", "Q8573_2.svg", "Q8573_3.svg", "Q8573_4.svg", "Q8573_5.svg", "Q8573_6.JPG", "Q8573_7.jpg", "Q8573_8.PNG", "Q8573_9.JPG", "Q8573_10.jpg", "Q8573_11.jpg", "Q8573_12.jpg", "Q8573_13.svg", "Q8573_14.svg", "Q8573_15.jpg", "Q8573_16.jpg", "Q8573_17.JPG", "Q8573_18.JPG", "Q8573_19.JPG", "Q8573_20.jpg", "Q8573_21.png", "Q8573_22.jpg", "Q8573_23.jpg", "Q8573_24.JPG", "Q8573_25.jpg", "Q8573_26.jpg", "Q8573_27.jpg", "Q8573_28.png", "Q8573_29.svg", "Q8573_30.jpg", "Q8573_31.svg", "Q8573_32.JPG", "Q8573_33.jpg", "Q8573_34.jpg"], "summary": "Sun Yat-sen:Sex: male.

While in Europe he was introduced to the ideas of the Enlightenment, which later motivated him to overthrow the reigning Spanish in colonial South America. Taking advantage of the disorder in Spain prompted by the Peninsular War, Bol\u00edvar began his campaign for independence in 1808. The campaign for the independence of Colombia (Gran Colombia\u2014later New Granada) was consolidated with the victory at the Battle of Boyac\u00e1 on 7 August 1819. He established an organized national congress within three years. Despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large Spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the victory at the Battle of Carabobo in 1821, which effectively made Venezuela an independent country.\nFollowing this triumph over the Spanish monarchy, Bol\u00edvar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in Latin America, Gran Colombia, of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. Through further military campaigns, he ousted Spanish rulers from Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, the last of which was named after him. He was simultaneously president of Gran Colombia (present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador), Peru, and Bolivia, but soon after, his second-in-command, Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre, was appointed president of Bolivia. Bol\u00edvar aimed at a strong and united Spanish America able to cope not only with the threats emanating from Spain and the European Holy Alliance but also with the emerging power of the United States. At the peak of his power, Bol\u00edvar ruled over a vast territory from the Argentine border to the Caribbean Sea.\nBol\u00edvar is viewed as a national icon in much of modern South America, and is considered one of the great heroes of the Hispanic independence movements of the early 19th century, along with Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, Francisco de Miranda and others. Towards the end of his life, Bol\u00edvar despaired of the situation in his native region, with the famous quote \"all who served the revolution have plowed the sea\".:\u200a450\u200a In an address to the Constituent Congress of the Republic of Colombia, Bol\u00edvar stated \"Fellow citizens!

He assumed the presidency as he was vice president at the time of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Johnson was a Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket, coming to office as the Civil War concluded. He favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union without protection for the former slaves. This led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.\nJohnson was born into poverty and never attended school. He was apprenticed as a tailor and worked in several frontier towns before settling in Greeneville, Tennessee. He served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1835. After briefly serving in the Tennessee Senate, Johnson was elected to the House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became governor of Tennessee for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the Homestead Bill which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862. Southern slave states seceded to form the Confederate States of America, including Tennessee, but Johnson remained firmly with the Union. He was the only sitting senator from a Confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state's secession. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as Military Governor of Tennessee after most of it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson was a logical choice as running mate for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; and became vice president after a victorious election in 1864.\nJohnson implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction, a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to reform their civil governments. Southern states returned many of their old leaders and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, but Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, he went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to break Republican opposition. As the conflict grew between the branches of government, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. He persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, but ended up being impeached by the House of Representatives and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate. He did not win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination and left office the following year.\nJohnson returned to Tennessee after his presidency and gained some vindication when he was elected to the Senate in 1875, making him the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died five months into his term. Johnson's strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for black Americans is widely criticized; he is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.", "img_list": ["Q8612_0.png", "Q8612_1.jpg", "Q8612_2.jpg", "Q8612_3.png", "Q8612_4.jpg", "Q8612_5.jpg", "Q8612_6.png", "Q8612_7.svg", "Q8612_8.jpg", "Q8612_9.png", "Q8612_10.jpg", "Q8612_11.jpg", "Q8612_12.jpg", "Q8612_13.jpg", "Q8612_14.jpg", "Q8612_15.jpg", "Q8612_16.jpg", "Q8612_17.svg", "Q8612_18.svg", "Q8612_19.svg", "Q8612_20.svg", "Q8612_21.jpg", "Q8612_22.png", "Q8612_23.svg", "Q8612_24.svg", "Q8612_25.svg", "Q8612_27.jpg", "Q8612_31.jpg", "Q8612_32.jpg", "Q8612_35.jpg"], "summary": "Andrew Johnson:Sex: male.

Although he aligned himself with the social democratic New Democratic Party, he felt that they could not achieve power, and instead joined the Liberal Party. He was elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1965, quickly being appointed as Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson's parliamentary secretary. In 1967, he was appointed as minister of justice and attorney general. Trudeau's outgoing personality and charismatic nature caused a media sensation, inspiring \"Trudeaumania\", and helped him to win the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1968, when he was appointed prime minister of Canada. From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, Trudeau's personality dominated the political scene to an extent never before seen in Canadian political life. After his appointment as prime minister, he won the 1968, 1972 and 1974 elections, before narrowly losing in 1979. He won a fourth election victory shortly afterwards, in 1980, and eventually retired from politics shortly before the 1984 election. Trudeau is the most recent prime minister to win four elections (having won three majority governments and one minority government) and to serve two non-consecutive terms as prime minister. His tenure of 15 years and 164 days makes him Canada's third-longest-serving prime minister, behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald.\nDespite his personal motto, \"Reason before passion\", Trudeau's personality and policy decisions aroused polarizing reactions throughout Canada during his time in office. While critics accused him of arrogance, of economic mismanagement, and of unduly centralizing Canadian decision-making to the detriment of the culture of Quebec and the economy of the Prairies, admirers praised what they considered to be the force of his intellect and his political acumen that maintained national unity over the Quebec sovereignty movement. Trudeau suppressed the 1970 Quebec terrorist crisis by controversially invoking the War Measures Act, the third and last time in Canadian history that the act was brought into force. In addition, Quebec's proposal to negotiate a sovereignty-association agreement with the federal government was overwhelmingly rejected in the 1980 Quebec referendum. \nIn a bid to move the Liberal Party towards economic nationalism, Trudeau's government oversaw the creation of Petro-Canada and launched the National Energy Program, a policy that was extremely unpopular in Western Canada and particularly in the oil-rich province of Alberta, leading to what many coined \"Western alienation\". In other domestic policy, Trudeau pioneered official bilingualism and multiculturalism, fostering a pan-Canadian identity. Trudeau's foreign policy included making Canada less dependent on the United States and the United Kingdom. He patriated the Constitution and established the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, actions that granted full Canadian sovereignty. He formed close ties with the Soviet Union, China, and Cuban leader Fidel Castro, putting him at odds with other capitalist Western nations. \nTrudeau is ranked highly among contemporary scholars in retrospective rankings of Canadian prime ministers. His eldest son, Justin Trudeau, became the 23rd and current prime minister, following the 2015 Canadian federal election, leading his party to re-election in 2019, and 2021, and is the first prime minister of Canada to be the child or other descendant of a former prime minister.", "img_list": ["Q8619_0.svg", "Q8619_1.svg", "Q8619_2.svg", "Q8619_3.svg", "Q8619_4.png", "Q8619_5.png", "Q8619_6.ogg", "Q8619_7.svg", "Q8619_8.jpg", "Q8619_9.svg", "Q8619_10.svg", "Q8619_11.svg", "Q8619_12.gif", "Q8619_13.svg", "Q8619_14.jpg", "Q8619_15.jpg", "Q8619_16.svg", "Q8619_17.tif", "Q8619_18.png", "Q8619_19.svg", "Q8619_20.jpg", "Q8619_21.svg"], "summary": "Pierre Trudeau:Sex: male.

In 1960, Ghanaians approved a new constitution and elected Nkrumah President.His administration was primarily socialist as well as nationalist. It funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and promoted a pan-Africanist culture.

He has been called the \"architect of the nuclear age\" and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\". He was one of very few physicists to excel in both theoretical physics and experimental physics. Fermi was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and for the discovery of transuranium elements. With his colleagues, Fermi filed several patents related to the use of nuclear power, all of which were taken over by the US government.  He made significant contributions to the development of statistical mechanics, quantum theory, and nuclear and particle physics.\nFermi's first major contribution involved the field of  statistical mechanics. After Wolfgang Pauli formulated his exclusion principle in 1925, Fermi followed with a paper in which he applied the principle to an ideal gas, employing a statistical formulation now known as Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics. Today, particles that obey the exclusion principle are called \"fermions\". Pauli later postulated the existence of an uncharged invisible particle emitted along with an electron during beta decay, to satisfy the law of conservation of energy. Fermi took up this idea, developing a model that incorporated the postulated particle, which he named the \"neutrino\". His theory, later referred to as Fermi's interaction and now called weak interaction, described one of the four fundamental interactions in nature. Through experiments inducing radioactivity with the recently discovered neutron, Fermi discovered that slow neutrons were more easily captured by atomic nuclei than fast ones, and he developed the Fermi age equation to describe this. After bombarding thorium and uranium with slow neutrons, he concluded that he had created new elements. Although he was awarded the Nobel Prize for this discovery, the new elements were later revealed to be nuclear fission products.\nFermi left Italy in 1938 to escape new Italian racial laws that affected his Jewish wife, Laura Capon. He emigrated to the United States, where he worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Fermi led the team that designed and built Chicago Pile-1, which went critical on 2 December 1942, demonstrating the first human-created, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. He was on hand when the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, went critical in 1943, and when the B Reactor at the Hanford Site did so the next year. At Los Alamos, he headed F Division, part of which worked on Edward Teller's thermonuclear \"Super\" bomb. He was present at the Trinity test on 16 July 1945, where he used his Fermi method to estimate the bomb's yield.\nAfter the war, Fermi served under J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters. After the detonation of the first Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed the development of a hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose when material was accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them. Fermi tutored or directly influenced no fewer than 8 young researchers who went on to win Nobel Prizes.", "img_list": ["Q8753_0.tif", "Q8753_1.svg", "Q8753_2.jpg", "Q8753_3.jpg", "Q8753_4.png", "Q8753_5.jpg", "Q8753_6.jpg", "Q8753_7.svg", "Q8753_8.jpg", "Q8753_9.jpg", "Q8753_10.jpg", "Q8753_11.jpg", "Q8753_12.jpg", "Q8753_13.jpg", "Q8753_14.svg", "Q8753_15.jpg", "Q8753_16.JPG", "Q8753_17.jpg", "Q8753_18.svg", "Q8753_19.jpg", "Q8753_20.jpg", "Q8753_21.jpg", "Q8753_22.svg", "Q8753_23.svg", "Q8753_24.svg", "Q8753_29.jpg"], "summary": "Enrico Fermi:Sex: male.

He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.\nChaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship, as his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, and he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious Fred Karno company, which took him to America. He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.\nIn 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists, which gave him complete control over his films. His first feature-length film was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). He initially refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. He became increasingly political, and his first sound film was The Great Dictator (1940), which satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, and some members of the press and public found his involvement in a paternity suit, and marriages to much younger women, scandalous. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong (1967).\nChaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterised by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. He received an Honorary Academy Award for \"the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century\" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work.

He was considered the de facto leader (1926\u201335) of the Second Polish Republic as the Minister of Military Affairs. After World War I, he held increasing dominance in Polish politics and was an active player in international diplomacy. He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the final Partition of Poland in 1795.Seeing himself as a descendant of the culture and traditions of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Pi\u0142sudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland\u2014\"a home of nations\" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities. Early in his political career, Pi\u0142sudski became a leader of the Polish Socialist Party. Believing Poland's independence would be won militarily, he formed the Polish Legions. In 1914, he predicted a new major war would defeat the Russian Empire and the Central Powers. After World War I began in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski's Legions fought alongside Austria-Hungary against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers, and was imprisoned in Magdeburg by the Germans.\nPi\u0142sudski was Poland's Chief of State from November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922. From 1919\u201321 he commanded Polish forces in six wars that re-defined the country's borders. On the verge of defeat in the Polish\u2013Soviet War in August 1920, his forces repelled the invading Soviet Russians at the Battle of Warsaw. In 1923, with a government dominated by his opponents, in particular the National Democrats, Pi\u0142sudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the May Coup and became the strongman of the Sanacja regime. He focused on military and foreign affairs until his death in 1935, developing a cult of personality that has survived into the 21st century.\nSome aspects of Pi\u0142sudski's administration, such as imprisoning his political opponents at Bereza Kartuska, remain controversial.

His name has been used as an adjective, a noun, and a school of social theory.\nMarx's critical theories about society, economics, and politics, collectively understood as Marxism, hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means by selling their labour-power in return for wages. Employing a critical approach known as historical materialism, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous socioeconomic systems and that those would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under capitalism\u2014owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature\u2014would eventuate the working class's development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of producers. Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about socio-economic emancipation.Marx has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and his work has been both lauded and criticised. His work in economics laid the basis for some current theories about labour and its relation to capital. Many intellectuals, labour unions, artists, and political parties worldwide have been influenced by Marx's work, with many modifying or adapting his ideas. Marx is typically cited as one of the principal architects of modern social science.", "img_list": ["Q9061_0.png", "Q9061_1.svg", "Q9061_2.svg", "Q9061_3.jpg", "Q9061_4.jpg", "Q9061_5.jpg", "Q9061_6.jpg", "Q9061_7.jpg", "Q9061_8.jpg", "Q9061_9.jpg", "Q9061_10.jpg", "Q9061_11.jpg", "Q9061_12.jpg", "Q9061_13.svg", "Q9061_14.jpg", "Q9061_15.jpg", "Q9061_16.jpg", "Q9061_17.jpg", "Q9061_18.jpg", "Q9061_19.jpg", "Q9061_20.jpg", "Q9061_21.jpg", "Q9061_22.jpg", "Q9061_23.jpg", "Q9061_24.svg", "Q9061_25.svg", "Q9061_26.svg", "Q9061_27.svg", "Q9061_28.png", "Q9061_29.svg", "Q9061_30.svg", "Q9061_31.svg", "Q9061_32.jpg", "Q9061_33.svg", "Q9061_34.svg", "Q9061_35.svg", "Q9061_36.svg", "Q9061_37.svg", "Q9061_38.jpg", "Q9061_41.jpg"], "summary": "Karl Marx:Sex: male.

During World War II, he was the leader of the Yugoslav Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in German-occupied Europe. He also served as the president of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 14 January 1953 until his death on 4 May 1980.\nBroz was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother in the village of Kumrovec, Austria-Hungary (now in Croatia). Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Russians during World War I, he was sent to a work camp in the Ural Mountains. He participated in some events of the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the subsequent Civil War. Upon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established Kingdom of Yugoslavia, where he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (KPJ). He later was elected as general secretary, later president, of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (1939\u20131980). During World War II, after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the Partisans (1941\u20131945). By the end of the war, the Partisans \u2014 with the backing of the invading Soviet Union \u2014 took power over Yugoslavia.\nAfter the war, he was the chief architect of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), serving as both prime minister (1944\u20131963), president (later President for life) (1953\u20131980), and marshal of Yugoslavia, the highest rank of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). Despite being one of the founders of Cominform, he became the first Cominform member to defy Soviet hegemony in 1948. He was the only leader in Joseph Stalin's time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's own socialist program, which contained elements of market socialism. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born Jaroslav Vanek and Yugoslav-born Branko Horvat, promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the Illyrian model. Firms were socially owned by their employees and structured on workers' self-management; they competed in open and free markets. Tito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The 1974 Yugoslav Constitution defined SFR Yugoslavia as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of brotherhood and unity in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to self-determination and secession if done through legal channels. Lastly, Tito gave Kosovo and Vojvodina, the two constituent provinces of Serbia, substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the Serbian parliament. Tito built a very powerful cult of personality around himself, which was maintained by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia after his death. Twelve years after his death, as communism collapsed in Eastern Europe, Yugoslavia dissolved and descended into a series of interethnic wars.\nAlthough some historians criticize his presidency as authoritarian, others see Tito as a benevolent dictator. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, alongside Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.

Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War and succeeded in preserving the Union, abolishing slavery, bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.\nLincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin and was raised on the frontier primarily in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. Congressman from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new Republican Party, and he reached a national audience in the 1858 debates against Stephen Douglas. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the North in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began seceding from the Union. To secure its independence, the new Confederate States fired on Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the Union.\nLincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. His allies, the War Democrats and the Radical Republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. Anti-war Democrats (called \"Copperheads\") despised Lincoln, and irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements plotted his assassination. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. His Gettysburg Address appealed to nationalistic, republican, egalitarian, libertarian, and democratic sentiments. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade of the South's trade. He suspended habeas corpus in Maryland, and he averted British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. He engineered the end to slavery with his Emancipation Proclamation, including his order that the Army and Navy liberate, protect, and recruit former slaves. He also encouraged border states to outlaw slavery, and promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.\nLincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife Mary when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth.

Originally trained in mathematics, he built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles. One of the most influential economists of the 20th century, his ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics, and its various offshoots.During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He argued that aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment, and that labour costs and wages were rigid downwards, which means the economy will not automatically rebound to full employment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, published in late 1936. By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting Keynes's policy recommendations. Almost all capitalist governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, Keynes participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of World War II but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.\nKeynes's influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists, who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with fiscal policy. However, the advent of the global financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 sparked a resurgence in Keynesian thought. Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.When Time magazine included Keynes among its Most Important People of the Century in 1999, it stated that \"his radical idea that governments should spend money they don't have may have saved capitalism.\" The Economist has described Keynes as \"Britain's most famous 20th-century economist.\" In addition to being an economist, Keynes was also a civil servant, a director of the Bank of England, and a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals.", "img_list": ["Q9317_0.jpg", "Q9317_1.jpg", "Q9317_3.svg", "Q9317_4.svg", "Q9317_5.jpg", "Q9317_6.jpg", "Q9317_7.svg", "Q9317_8.jpg", "Q9317_9.svg", "Q9317_10.jpg", "Q9317_11.jpg", "Q9317_12.png", "Q9317_13.jpg", "Q9317_14.jpg", "Q9317_15.jpg", "Q9317_16.jpg", "Q9317_17.svg", "Q9317_18.svg", "Q9317_19.jpg", "Q9317_20.jpg", "Q9317_21.svg", "Q9317_22.svg", "Q9317_23.svg", "Q9317_26.jpg"], "summary": "John Maynard Keynes:Sex: male.

He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.\nIn the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton's inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.\nNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.\nNewton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689\u20131690 and 1701\u20131702. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696\u20131699) and Master (1699\u20131727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703\u20131727).", "img_list": ["Q935_0.jpg", "Q935_1.jpg", "Q935_2.jpg", "Q935_3.svg", "Q935_4.jpg", "Q935_5.ogg", "Q935_6.jpg", "Q935_7.svg", "Q935_8.jpg", "Q935_9.jpg", "Q935_10.jpg", "Q935_11.jpg", "Q935_12.jpg", "Q935_13.jpg", "Q935_14.jpg", "Q935_15.jpg", "Q935_16.jpg", "Q935_17.svg", "Q935_18.svg", "Q935_19.jpg", "Q935_20.jpg", "Q935_21.jpg", "Q935_22.jpg", "Q935_23.jpg", "Q935_24.png", "Q935_25.jpg", "Q935_26.svg", "Q935_27.svg", "Q935_28.svg", "Q935_29.svg", "Q935_30.svg", "Q935_31.svg", "Q935_32.svg", "Q935_34.jpg"], "summary": "Isaac Newton:Sex: male.

Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass\u2013energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world's most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\".In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. \nHowever, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature \"does not play dice\". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.\nEinstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Z\u00fcrich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.\nIn 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, of Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government; he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons."
