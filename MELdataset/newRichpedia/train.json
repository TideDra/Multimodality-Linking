In industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, and precursors to catalysts.\nWhen used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned. In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins. It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.Soap is created by mixing fats and oils with a base, as opposed to detergent which is created by combining chemical compounds in a mixer.\nHumans have used soap for millennia.

They had specialists, the diviners, to interpret these omens. They would also use an artificial method, for example, a clay model of a sheep liver, to communicate with their gods in times of crisis. They would expect a binary answer, either yes or no answer, favourable or unfavourable. They did these to predict what would happen in the future and to take action to avoid disaster.Though the word \"omen\" is usually devoid of reference to the change's nature, hence being possibly either \"good\" or \"bad,\" the term is more often used in a foreboding sense, as with the word \"ominous\".
